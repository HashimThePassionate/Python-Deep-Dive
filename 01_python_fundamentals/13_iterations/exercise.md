# üìù Loop-Focused Exercise Statements

1. **Rental Car Availability**: Write a program that repeatedly asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. If the user types "exit," the program should end. Otherwise, it should print a message such as "Let me see if I can find you a [car]." The program should keep running until the user decides to exit.

2. **Restaurant Seating Check**: Write a program that repeatedly asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they‚Äôll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready. The program should continue asking until the user types "done."

3. **Check Multiples of Ten Continuously**: Write a program that continuously asks the user for a number and then reports whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not. The program should stop if the user types "stop."

4. **Password Validation Loop**: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and checks if it meets a specific condition (e.g., length of at least 8 characters). If it doesn‚Äôt, the program should ask the user to input the password again. This should continue until the user enters a valid password.

5. **Number Pyramid Pattern**: Write a program that generates a number pyramid pattern based on the number of levels specified by the user. The program should use nested loops to generate the pattern.

6. **Guess the Number Game**: Write a loop-based program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. The user has to guess the number, and the program should provide feedback ("too high" or "too low") until the user guesses the correct number. The game should continue asking until the correct number is guessed.

7. **Factorial Calculator Using a Loop**: Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to input a number and then calculates the factorial of that number using a loop. The program should continue asking until the user types "exit."

8. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: Write a program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number entered by the user. Use a loop to generate the sequence until the user decides to stop.
