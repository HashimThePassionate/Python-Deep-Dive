# Operators in Python ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

In this section, we'll discuss **operators** in Python, which are symbols or combinations of symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Understanding operators is crucial for working with expressions and performing calculations in Python.

## What are Operators? ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Operators** are non-alphanumeric characters and combinations of characters that Python uses to perform operations on data.
- Python recognizes a variety of operators, each with its specific functionality.

## List of Common Operators in Python üî¢

Here is a list of the most commonly used operators in Python:

### Arithmetic Operators ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus (remainder after division)
- `**` : Exponentiation (power)
- `//` : Floor division (division that results in the largest whole number less than or equal to the result)

### Example:
```python
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # 13
print(a - b)  # 7
print(a * b)  # 30
print(a / b)  # 3.3333...
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a ** b) # 1000
print(a // b) # 3
```
### Comparison Operators üîç

- `<` : Less than
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to

### Example:
```python
a = 5
b = 3

print(a < b)   # False
print(a <= b)  # False
print(a > b)   # True
print(a >= b)  # True
print(a == b)  # False
print(a != b)  # True
```


## Summary üìù

Python provides a wide range of operators that you can use for arithmetic calculations, bitwise operations, comparisons, and more. In Python v3, the `@` operator was introduced for matrix multiplication, expanding the capabilities of Python in handling mathematical operations efficiently.
