# üìù Exercises

### 1. **Buffet: Menu Management**

A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.

- Use a `for` loop to print each food the restaurant offers.
- Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.
- The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. Add a line that rewrites the tuple, and then use a `for` loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.

### 2. **Geographic Coordinates**

Create a program that stores the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of three different cities in a tuple. Then:

- Print each city's coordinates in a formatted string.
- Attempt to change the coordinates of one city and observe the error.
- Simulate updating the coordinates by reassigning the entire tuple.

### 3. **Immutable Game Settings**

Create a program that stores game settings like resolution, audio level, and difficulty level in a tuple. Then:

- Print the current settings.
- Try to change one of the settings and handle the error appropriately.
- Provide an option to "reset" all settings by reassigning the tuple.

### 4. **Student Grades Tracker**

Write a program that stores a tuple of five students' names and another tuple of their corresponding grades. Then:

- Print each student's name with their grade.
- Attempt to modify a grade and show that it's not possible.
- Simulate correcting a mistake by creating a new tuple of grades.

### 5. **Sorting and Tuple Packing**

Create a program that accepts a list of numbers from the user and converts it to a tuple. Then:

- Print the sorted tuple without modifying the original tuple.
- Pack and unpack the sorted tuple into separate variables and print them.

### 6. **Top 3 Favorite Movies**

Create a program that stores your top 3 favorite movies in a tuple. Then:

- Print them in order.
- Swap the first and last movie using tuple packing/unpacking.
- Show the tuple before and after the swap.

### 7. **Tuple Calculator**

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers and then stores them in a tuple. Provide options for the user to perform different mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using these numbers.

- Print the results of the operations without modifying the tuple.
- Handle cases where the user might attempt to modify the tuple and show that it‚Äôs not possible.

### 8. **Quiz Game with Tuples**

Create a quiz game using tuples to store questions and their corresponding answers. Then:

- Ask the user each question.
- Check their answers against the tuple of correct answers.
- Keep track of the score and display it at the end.

### 9. **Month Temperature Tracker**

Store the average monthly temperatures (in Celsius) for a year in a tuple. Then:

- Calculate and print the average temperature of the year.
- Find the hottest and coldest month without modifying the tuple.
- Simulate updating the temperatures by creating a new tuple.

### 10. **3D Vector Operations**

Create a program that stores two 3D vectors in tuples. Then:

- Print their original values.
- Compute their dot product and cross product using functions without modifying the tuples.
- Display the results of these operations.

### 11. **Filter Cities Based on Longitude**

Create a program that displays the name, latitude, and longitude of metro areas where the longitude is less than or equal to 0. Use a tuple to represent each city's information.

- Define a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the city name, country code, population (in millions), and another tuple containing latitude and longitude.
- Loop through the list and unpack the tuples.
- Check if the longitude is less than or equal to 0.
- If it is, print the city's name, latitude, and longitude in a formatted manner.
