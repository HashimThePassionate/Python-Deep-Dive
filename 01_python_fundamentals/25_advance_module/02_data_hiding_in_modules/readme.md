# 📚 **Data Hiding in Modules** 🐍

In Python, **data hiding** is more about convention than restriction. Unlike some programming languages, Python does not enforce strict access controls. Instead, it relies on **naming conventions** and certain mechanisms to guide developers on which elements should be treated as "private." This section covers how to use these conventions effectively to manage visibility and control namespace pollution. Let's explore! 🚀

## **Introduction** 📚

Unlike languages that enforce strict data hiding, Python's philosophy is to encourage responsible usage by **convention**. You can access all names defined in a module, but certain practices can help guide how elements should be treated and used. This enables encapsulation without strict restrictions.

## **Understanding Data Hiding in Modules**

In Python, every name defined at the top level of a module is **exported**:
- You can **import** any name unless explicitly discouraged.
- **Data hiding** is achieved by conventions rather than by compiler checks.

### **Minimizing `from *` Damage** 🛡️

The `from module import *` syntax imports all names from a module into the current namespace. This can lead to **namespace pollution** and unexpected behavior, as it might overwrite existing names.

To manage this, Python offers two primary ways:
1. **Single underscore prefix (`_X`)**.
2. **The `__all__` list**.


### **1. Using Single Underscore `_X`** 🔒

Names prefixed with a **single underscore** (e.g., `_var`) are treated as **non-public**:
- The `from *` syntax will **not** import names that start with an underscore.
- However, you can still import these names explicitly if needed.

**Example:**
```python
# module.py
a = 10
_b = 20  # Non-public

# Using from * will only import 'a' and skip '_b'
from module import *
print(a)    # Works
print(_b)   # Raises NameError
```

### **2. The `__all__` Variable** 📋

To control which names get exported when using `from *`, define a list called `__all__`. This list specifies the **only** names that should be imported:
- If `__all__` is defined, `from *` will **only** import the names in this list.
- It can override the `_X` convention.

**Example:**
```python
# module.py
__all__ = ['a', '_b']  # Specify which names should be accessible

a = 10
b = 20
_b = 30  # Non-public but still accessible due to __all__
```


## **Practical Examples**

### **Example 1: Using `_X` Convention** 🧩

```python
# File: underscore_example.py
a, _b, c, _d = 1, 2, 3, 4

# Interactive session:
from underscore_example import *
print(a, c)  # Outputs: 1 3
print(_b)    # Raises NameError

# You can still import directly:
import underscore_example
print(underscore_example._b)  # Outputs: 2
```

### **Example 2: Using `__all__`** ✨

```python
# File: all_example.py
__all__ = ['x', '_y']  # Explicitly export these names

x, y, _y, z = 5, 10, 15, 20

# Interactive session:
from all_example import *
print(x, _y)   # Outputs: 5 15
print(y)       # Raises NameError
```


## **Best Practices** 🏆

1. **Avoid Using `from *`**:
   - Explicit imports make the code more readable and predictable.
   
2. **Use Single Underscore for Non-Public Members**:
   - Use `_` prefix to indicate internal elements, discouraging external access.
   
3. **Define `__all__` to Control Namespace Exposure**:
   - Clearly state which names should be accessible, making the module easier to understand and use.
   
4. **Rely on Conventions Rather Than Enforced Privacy**:
   - Python trusts developers to follow best practices. Be mindful of naming conventions and avoid accessing non-public members unless absolutely necessary.


## **Summary** 📜

In this section, we covered **data hiding** in Python modules:
- **Python does not enforce strict data privacy** but relies on conventions to guide usage.
- Use a **single underscore** (`_X`) to mark elements as non-public.
- Define **`__all__`** to explicitly state which elements should be imported when using `from *`.
- Follow **best practices** to ensure clean and maintainable code.

By understanding these mechanisms, you can create more organized, robust, and user-friendly modules. Happy coding! 🎉
