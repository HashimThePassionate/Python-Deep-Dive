# 📖 **Getting Started with Python Environments**

Welcome to this **simple overview** of Python environments. This will help you understand why using virtual environments can make your life easier when working on different Python projects. We’ll also look at how to install packages and keep track of your dependencies.

---

## 🌱 What Are Virtual Environments?

A **virtual environment** is like a mini version of Python, just for one project. It has its own place to store packages (libraries) and doesn’t mess with other projects on your system.

### Why Use a Virtual Environment?
- **Security**: You don’t need special (admin or superuser) permissions to install packages, reducing risks of installing malware.
- **No Conflicts**: Each project can have specific package versions without affecting other projects.
- **Easier Upgrades**: Updating a package in one project won’t break other projects’ code.
- **Clearer Dependencies**: You can list exactly which packages your project needs, making everything tidy.

---

## 🛠 How to Manage Packages

### PyPI and Conda-Forge
- **PyPI** (Python Package Index) is the main place to find Python libraries. You’ll often use `pip install <package_name>` to get them.
- **Conda-Forge** is linked to the **Anaconda** ecosystem. You can install packages with `conda install <package_name>`.

### Examples of Installing Packages
```bash
# Using pip
pip install requests

# Using conda
conda install requests
```

---

## 📜 Tracking Dependencies

It’s important to keep track of all the libraries your project needs. This helps you (and others) to recreate the same environment later. Common ways include:

- A simple `requirements.txt` file (used with `pip`).
- A `Pipfile` (used with `pipenv`).
- A `pyproject.toml` (used with `poetry`).

---

## 🤔 Quick Example

Imagine you have a **Django** web project that needs version `3.2` of Django. Another project might need version `4.1`. If you installed Django globally, you’d only have one version on your system. This could cause a problem if one project needs the older version.

**Solution**: Create a virtual environment for each project:
1. Project A uses Django 3.2
2. Project B uses Django 4.1

No conflicts! Both can run on the same computer without clashing.

---

# 🏗 What Are `venv` and `virtualenv`?

- **`virtualenv`**: A library that creates virtual environments for your Python projects.
- **`venv`** (available by default in Python 3.3+): A built-in tool that acts almost like a drop-in replacement for `virtualenv`.

Both help you avoid conflicts between different projects’ dependencies.

---

## 📂 Where Should You Put Your Environment?

Instead of creating your `env` (or `.venv`, `venv`) **inside** the project folder, you can keep it somewhere else. Why?

1. **Faster & Lighter Backups**  
   If you keep the environment **outside** your main project, you don’t waste time and space backing up all the installed packages again and again.

2. **Portability**  
   You can move or share your project without dragging along its virtual environment. This means you can store your project on a flash drive or remote drive and keep it super portable.

3. **No Source Control Bloats**  
   Virtual environment files can clutter your version control system (like Git). If the environment is outside the project, you won’t risk accidentally uploading these files.

> **Tip**: If you do keep the environment in your project, remember to add the environment folder (for example, `.venv`) to your `.gitignore` or similar files so it’s not committed to source control.

# 🌐 Creating a `venv` – Simple Guide

Below is a quick, **beginner-friendly** overview of how to create and activate a Python virtual environment on different operating systems. We’ll also look at some important points to keep in mind. Don’t worry if you’re new; this guide will walk you through the basics!

---

## 📂 Current Location

> **Your location**: `DELL` on `~/Desktop/Python-Deep-Dive` (main branch)

This means you’ll likely be running commands from:
```
~/Desktop/Python-Deep-Dive
```
But feel free to adjust paths to fit your own folder structure.

---

## 🏗 Steps to Create and Activate a `venv`

### 1. Linux/Unix/macOS
Using **zsh** or **bash**:
```bash
# Step 1: Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv envs/your_env

# Step 2: Activate the environment
source envs/your_env/bin/activate

# After this, you'll see a prompt like:
(your_env) $
```
- **(your_env)** in front of your prompt indicates you’re in the virtual environment.

### 2. Windows (cmd.exe)
```cmd
# Step 1: Create the virtual environment
python.exe -m venv envs\your_env

# Step 2: Activate the environment
envs\your_env\Scripts\activate.bat

# Prompt will change to:
(your_env) C:\Users\YourName>
```

### 3. Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Step 1: Create the virtual environment
python.exe -m venv envs\your_env

# Step 2: Activate the environment
envs\your_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Prompt will change to:
(your_env) PS C:\Users\YourName>
```

> **Note**: If you run into permission issues in PowerShell, you might need to adjust the execution policy:
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No `sudo` Required**  
   You do **not** need superuser privileges (like `sudo`) to create or activate virtual environments. Using `sudo` can be a security risk.

2. **Install Missing Packages**  
   - If you’re on Ubuntu, you might need to install:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install python3-venv
     ```
     because Ubuntu’s default Python sometimes excludes `ensurepip`.

3. **Venv vs Virtualenv**  
   - **`venv`** is built into Python 3.3+.
   - **`virtualenv`** is an external library that offers similar functionality.
   - Either one works, but `venv` is often preferred if you’re already on Python 3.3+.

4. **Why the `(your_env)` Prefix?**  
   - It helps you see that you’re “inside” a virtual environment. Any `python` or `pip` commands will only affect this environment.

---

# 🌐 Using `virtualenv` (Instead of `venv`) – Simple Overview

Below is a **friendly guide** to help you create and activate Python virtual environments using **`virtualenv`**. It also shows you how to specify different Python interpreter versions!

---

## 📍 Your Current Directory
> **Location**:  
> `C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Python-Deep-Dive\01_python_fundamentals\27_virtual_environment>`

This means your commands will be run from:
```
C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\Python-Deep-Dive\01_python_fundamentals\27_virtual_environment>
```
Feel free to adapt the path to match your folder names.

---

## 🤔 Why `virtualenv`?

- You can easily specify which **Python version** to use (e.g., `python3.8`).
- It’s an alternative to `venv`, especially handy if you’re on older Python versions or want more flexibility.

---

## 🔨 Creating a Virtual Environment with `virtualenv`

1. **Basic Command**  
   ```bash
   virtualenv envs/your_env
   ```
   - This works just like `python3 -m venv envs/your_env`.

2. **Choosing a Specific Python Version**  
   ```bash
   virtualenv -p python3.8 envs/your_env
   ```
   or  
   ```bash
   virtualenv --python=python3.8 envs/your_env
   ```
   - This will create a new environment using **Python 3.8**.  

> **Alternatively**, if you’re using `venv`, you can do:
> ```bash
> python3.8 -m venv envs/your_env
> ```
> But that’s a slightly different syntax than `virtualenv`.

## 🚀 Activating Your Environment

Once you create your virtual environment, you need to **activate** it before installing packages or running Python scripts inside it.

### 🐧 Linux/Unix (bash or zsh)
```bash
source envs/your_env/bin/activate
(your_env) $
```

### 🪟 Windows (cmd.exe)
```cmd
envs\your_env\Scripts\activate.bat
(your_env) C:\Users\YourName>
```

### 🔹 Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
envs\your_env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
(your_env) PS C:\Users\YourName>
```

> **Tip**: The `(your_env)` prefix indicates you’re inside the virtual environment!

---

## 🎉 Why Activate?

**When activated**, your system’s `PATH` is updated so that:
1. Any `python` or `pip` command now refers to **your_env**’s Python and pip.  
2. Your prompt changes to `(your_env)`—a clear reminder you’re using a separate environment.

# 🚀 Installing Packages in Your Virtual Environment

Below is a **simple** explanation of how to install Python packages inside a virtual environment, see which packages you’ve installed, and optionally share packages between your system and your virtual environment.

---

## 🍃 Isolated Package Installs

### Basic Installation
When your virtual environment is **activated**, you can install packages as usual:
```bash
pip3 install <package>
```
All installed packages are kept **separate** from your system’s global Python packages.

### Listing Installed Packages
```bash
pip3 freeze
```
You’ll see only the packages (and dependencies) installed **in** your virtual environment – no extra clutter.

---

## 🔗 Using System Packages (Optional)

Sometimes, you might want your environment to access **system** packages (for example, you have a system-installed package that you don’t want to reinstall). In that case, you can create the environment like this:
```bash
python.exe -m venv --system-site-packages envs/your_env
```
This tells Python to **append** system packages to your environment’s search path:
- If a package isn’t found in the environment, Python will check your system’s global packages.

### Listing Only Local Packages
If you choose to allow system packages, your `pip3 freeze` might show **everything**, including system-wide packages. To limit the listing to **just** local packages:
```bash
pip3 freeze --local
```
You’ll then see only the packages actually installed in your virtual environment, ignoring any system-wide packages.


Explicitly installing or updating a package within your virtual environment will effectively
hide the system package from within your virtual environment. Uninstalling the package
from your virtual environment will make it reappear.
