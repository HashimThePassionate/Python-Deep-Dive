### 📄 Problem 2.1

Create a regular expression to exactly match this gloriously contrived sentence:

```
The punctuation characters in the ASCII table are: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~.
```

### 📝 Answer

```python
import re

# The given sentence
sentence = r'The punctuation characters in the ASCII table are: !"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~.'

# Regular expression to exactly match the sentence
regex = r'^The punctuation characters in the ASCII table are: [!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\]^_`{|}~.]+$'

# Check if the sentence matches the regular expression
match = re.match(regex, sentence)

if match:
    print("The sentence matches the regular expression.")
else:
    print("The sentence does not match the regular expression.")
```

### 📚 Detailed Explanation

#### 🔍 Understanding the Sentence:

The sentence to match is:

```
The punctuation characters in the ASCII table are: !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~.
```

This sentence includes a string of punctuation characters from the ASCII table.

#### 🛠️ Constructing the Regular Expression:

- `^`: Asserts the position at the start of the string.
- `The punctuation characters in the ASCII table are: `: Matches the exact literal string.
- `[!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~.]+`: Matches one or more of any of the listed punctuation characters. Note the following:
  - `\\`: Escapes the backslash character.
  - `^` and `[` are inside the character class and do not need to be escaped.
- `$`: Asserts the position at the end of the string.

Combined, this regular expression ensures that the entire string exactly matches the given sentence, including all punctuation characters and spacing.

#### 🧪 Matching the Sentence:

The `re.match` function is used to check if the entire string matches the regular expression from the start to the end. If it matches, the function returns a match object; otherwise, it returns `None`.

#### 🖥️ Code Execution:

- The given sentence is defined using a raw string (using `r'...'`) to handle the backslashes correctly.
- The regular expression is applied to the sentence.
- The result is printed based on whether the sentence matches the regular expression.

By following these steps, we ensure that the regular expression matches the exact sentence, including all punctuation characters.
