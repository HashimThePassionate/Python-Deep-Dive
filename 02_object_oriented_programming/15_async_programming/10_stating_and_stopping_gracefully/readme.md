## 1. 🌟 **Introduction**

Building long-running, network-based applications with `asyncio` involves more than just writing asynchronous coroutines. Properly managing the **startup** and **shutdown** phases of your application is crucial to ensure that resources are allocated and released correctly, and that your application can terminate without leaving dangling tasks or open connections. This guide will walk you through the essentials of starting up and shutting down asyncio applications gracefully, helping you avoid common errors and build robust systems.


## 2. 🔧 **Starting Up an Asyncio Application**

### Using `asyncio.run()`

The standard and most straightforward way to start an asyncio application is by using the `asyncio.run()` function. Introduced in Python 3.7, `asyncio.run()` simplifies the process by handling the event loop's lifecycle for you.

**Key Features of `asyncio.run()`:**

- **Creates a New Event Loop 🌀:** Ensures that a fresh event loop is used for each run, avoiding conflicts with existing loops.
- **Runs the `main()` Coroutine 🏁:** Executes the provided coroutine until it completes.
- **Handles Shutdown Automatically 🔄:** Manages the shutdown process, including cancelling pending tasks.

**Basic Structure:**

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Your asynchronous code here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### The `main()` Coroutine Function

The `main()` function serves as the entry point for your asynchronous application. It's where you set up your application's components, such as servers, clients, or background tasks.

**Example:**

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    print("🚀 Starting up the asyncio application...")
    # Initialize resources, start servers, etc.
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate asynchronous operations
    print("🏁 Asyncio application is running.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
🚀 Starting up the asyncio application...
🏁 Asyncio application is running.
```


## 3. ⚙️ **Shutting Down Gracefully**

While starting up an asyncio application is relatively straightforward, **shutting it down gracefully** involves careful handling to ensure that all tasks are completed, resources are released, and no pending tasks are left behind.

### Understanding `asyncio.run()` Shutdown Process

When `asyncio.run()` completes the execution of the `main()` coroutine, it performs the following shutdown steps automatically:

1. **Collect Pending Tasks 🗂️:**
   - Gathers all tasks that are still running or pending in the event loop.
   
2. **Cancel Pending Tasks ❌:**
   - Sends cancellation signals to these tasks by invoking their `cancel()` method.
   
3. **Await Task Completion ⏳:**
   - Waits for all cancelled tasks to handle the `CancelledError` exception and terminate properly.
   
4. **Close the Event Loop 🔒:**
   - Ensures that the event loop is closed, releasing all associated resources.

### Common Shutdown Steps

To manage shutdown manually (without `asyncio.run()`), you can follow these steps:

1. **Retrieve All Pending Tasks:**

   ```python
   pending = asyncio.all_tasks(loop=asyncio.get_running_loop())
   ```

2. **Cancel All Pending Tasks:**

   ```python
   for task in pending:
       task.cancel()
   ```

3. **Await Task Completion:**

   ```python
   await asyncio.gather(*pending, return_exceptions=True)
   ```

4. **Close the Event Loop:**

   ```python
   loop.close()
   ```

### Avoiding “Task was destroyed but it is pending!” Error

One common error encountered during shutdown is:

```
Task was destroyed but it is pending!
task: <Task pending coro=<...>>
```

**Cause:** This error occurs when tasks are still pending (not completed) when the event loop is closed. It indicates that these tasks were not properly cancelled or awaited during the shutdown process.

**Solution:** Ensure that all pending tasks are cancelled and awaited before closing the event loop. Using `asyncio.run()` handles this automatically, but if managing manually, follow the shutdown steps meticulously.


## 4. 🚫 **Common Pitfalls in Shutdown**

### Creating Tasks Inside Cancellation Handlers

One subtle but critical pitfall is **creating new tasks inside cancellation handlers**. When a task is cancelled (e.g., due to shutdown), if you spawn new tasks within the `except asyncio.CancelledError` block, these new tasks might not be properly managed, leading to pending tasks and the aforementioned error.

**Problematic Example:**

```python
import asyncio

async def send_event(msg: str):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"📡 Event Sent: {msg}")

async def handle_connection():
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate handling connection
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("🔴 Connection handler cancelled.")
        asyncio.create_task(send_event("Connection dropped!"))  # Problematic
        raise

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(handle_connection())
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    task.cancel()
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
🔴 Connection handler cancelled.
Task was destroyed but it is pending!
task: <Task pending coro=<send_event() done, defined at ...>>
```

**Explanation:**
- The `handle_connection()` coroutine creates a new task (`send_event`) inside its cancellation handler.
- When `main()` cancels `handle_connection()`, it doesn't wait for `send_event` to complete, leaving it pending.
- As a result, when the event loop shuts down, it detects the pending `send_event` task and raises the error.

**Solution:**
- **Avoid Creating New Tasks Inside Cancellation Handlers.**
- **If Necessary, Await Them Within the Same Function.**

**Corrected Example:**

```python
import asyncio

async def send_event(msg: str):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print(f"📡 Event Sent: {msg}")

async def handle_connection():
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate handling connection
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print("🔴 Connection handler cancelled.")
        await send_event("Connection dropped!")  # Await instead of creating a new task
        raise

async def main():
    task = asyncio.create_task(handle_connection())
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    task.cancel()
    await task

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output:**
```
🔴 Connection handler cancelled.
📡 Event Sent: Connection dropped!
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures that all tasks are awaited and completed before shutdown.
- Prevents the creation of lingering tasks that can cause shutdown errors.


## 5. 🔍 **Detailed Shutdown Process**

Understanding the shutdown process in `asyncio` helps in managing tasks effectively and preventing common errors. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to shut down an asyncio application gracefully.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Identify All Pending Tasks:**
   - Use `asyncio.all_tasks()` to gather all tasks that are still running or pending.
   
   ```python
   pending = asyncio.all_tasks()
   ```

2. **Cancel All Pending Tasks:**
   - Iterate over the pending tasks and call `cancel()` on each.
   
   ```python
   for task in pending:
       task.cancel()
   ```

3. **Await Task Completion:**
   - Use `asyncio.gather()` with `return_exceptions=True` to wait for all tasks to handle cancellation and terminate.
   
   ```python
   await asyncio.gather(*pending, return_exceptions=True)
   ```

4. **Close the Event Loop:**
   - Once all tasks are completed, close the event loop to release resources.
   
   ```python
   loop.close()
   ```

5. **Handle Exceptions Appropriately:**
   - Inside your coroutines, handle `asyncio.CancelledError` to perform necessary cleanup without propagating the exception further.
   
   ```python
   async def some_coroutine():
       try:
           while True:
               await asyncio.sleep(1)
       except asyncio.CancelledError:
           print("🔴 Coroutine cancelled. Cleaning up...")
           # Perform cleanup here
           raise
   ```

## 6. 🛠️ **Real-World Example: TCP Echo Server**

To illustrate the concepts of graceful startup and shutdown in a real-world scenario, we'll build a simple **TCP Echo Server**. This server will accept incoming connections, echo back any received data in uppercase, and handle shutdown gracefully without leaving any pending tasks or open connections.

### Overview

- **Server Functionality 📡:**
  - Listens for incoming TCP connections.
  - For each connection, it echoes back received messages in uppercase.
  - Handles multiple clients concurrently.
  
- **Graceful Shutdown 🔄:**
  - On receiving a shutdown signal (e.g., Ctrl-C), it stops accepting new connections.
  - Cancels all active client handler tasks.
  - Ensures all resources are released properly without errors.

### Code Implementation

```python
# tcp_echo_server.py
import asyncio

async def handle_client(reader: asyncio.StreamReader, writer: asyncio.StreamWriter):
    addr = writer.get_extra_info('peername')
    print(f"👤 New connection from {addr}")
    try:
        while True:
            data = await reader.readline()
            if not data:
                print(f"🔌 Connection closed by {addr}")
                break
            message = data.decode().strip()
            print(f"💬 Received from {addr}: {message}")
            response = message.upper() + '\n'
            writer.write(response.encode())
            await writer.drain()
    except asyncio.CancelledError:
        print(f"🚨 Connection with {addr} is being closed gracefully.")
        writer.close()
        await writer.wait_closed()
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error with {addr}: {e}")
    finally:
        print(f"🔒 Connection with {addr} has been closed.")

async def main(host='127.0.0.1', port=8888):
    server = await asyncio.start_server(handle_client, host, port)
    addr = server.sockets[0].getsockname()
    print(f"🚀 Serving on {addr}")
    
    async with server:
        try:
            await server.serve_forever()
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            print("🛑 Server is shutting down...")
            server.close()
            await server.wait_closed()
            tasks = [task for task in asyncio.all_tasks() if task is not asyncio.current_task()]
            print(f"📋 Cancelling {len(tasks)} active tasks...")
            for task in tasks:
                task.cancel()
            await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
            print("✅ Shutdown complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        asyncio.run(main())
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("✋ Received exit signal. Exiting gracefully...")
```

### Running and Testing the Server

1. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   $ python tcp_echo_server.py
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   🚀 Serving on ('127.0.0.1', 8888)
   ```

2. **Connect Using Telnet:**

   Open a new terminal window and use Telnet to connect to the server.

   ```bash
   $ telnet 127.0.0.1 8888
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   hello
   HELLO
   world
   WORLD
   ^]
   Connection closed.
   ```

   **Server Output:**
   ```
   👤 New connection from ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
   💬 Received from ('127.0.0.1', 54321): hello
   💬 Received from ('127.0.0.1', 54321): world
   🔌 Connection closed by ('127.0.0.1', 54321)
   🔒 Connection with ('127.0.0.1', 54321) has been closed.
   ```

### Graceful Shutdown Demonstration

1. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   $ python tcp_echo_server.py
   ```

   **Output:**
   ```
   🚀 Serving on ('127.0.0.1', 8888)
   ```

2. **Connect Using Telnet and Leave Connection Open:**

   ```bash
   $ telnet 127.0.0.1 8888
   Trying 127.0.0.1...
   Connected to 127.0.0.1.
   Escape character is '^]'.
   hi
   HI
   # Leave the connection open
   ```

3. **Initiate Shutdown (Ctrl-C):**

   In the server terminal, press **Ctrl-C** to stop the server.

   **Server Output:**
   ```
   🛑 Server is shutting down...
   📋 Cancelling 1 active tasks...
   🚨 Connection with ('127.0.0.1', 54321) is being closed gracefully.
   ✅ Shutdown complete.
   ✋ Received exit signal. Exiting gracefully...
   ```

4. **Telnet Output After Shutdown:**

   ```bash
   ^]
   telnet> quit
   Connection closed.
   ```

**Explanation:**

- **Server Shutdown:**
  - Upon receiving a shutdown signal (Ctrl-C), the server enters the shutdown phase.
  - It closes the server socket, preventing new connections.
  - It identifies all active tasks (client handlers) and cancels them.
  - Each `handle_client` coroutine handles the `CancelledError` by closing the client connection gracefully.
  - After all tasks are cancelled and awaited, the server confirms that shutdown is complete.

- **Client Connection Handling:**
  - The active Telnet connection is closed gracefully without leaving pending tasks.
  - No "Task was destroyed but it is pending!" errors are raised, indicating a successful shutdown.


## 7. ✅ **Best Practices**

Ensuring a graceful startup and shutdown in asyncio applications involves adhering to several best practices:

### 1. **Use `asyncio.run()` for Entry Point 🚀**

- **Why:** It simplifies the event loop management by handling startup and shutdown automatically.
- **How:** Define a `main()` coroutine and pass it to `asyncio.run()`.

  ```python
  async def main():
      # Your async code here
      pass

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      asyncio.run(main())
  ```

### 2. **Handle `CancelledError` Appropriately ❌🛑**

- **Why:** To ensure that your coroutines can clean up resources when they are cancelled.
- **How:** Use try-except blocks to catch `asyncio.CancelledError` and perform necessary cleanup.

  ```python
  async def some_coroutine():
      try:
          while True:
              await asyncio.sleep(1)
      except asyncio.CancelledError:
          # Perform cleanup
          print("🔴 Coroutine was cancelled.")
          raise
  ```

### 3. **Avoid Creating New Tasks in Cancellation Handlers 🚫🧩**

- **Why:** It can lead to pending tasks that are not awaited, causing shutdown errors.
- **How:** If you need to perform additional operations during cancellation, await them within the same coroutine instead of creating new tasks.

  ```python
  async def handle_connection():
      try:
          while True:
              await asyncio.sleep(1)
      except asyncio.CancelledError:
          await cleanup_resources()  # Await directly
          raise
  ```

### 4. **Ensure All Resources Are Released Properly 🔒🛠️**

- **Why:** To prevent resource leaks and ensure that your application terminates cleanly.
- **How:** Use async context managers (`async with`) to manage resources like network connections, files, etc.

  ```python
  async def main():
      async with some_async_resource() as resource:
          # Use the resource
          pass
  ```

### 5. **Monitor and Manage Active Tasks 📋👀**

- **Why:** To keep track of running tasks and ensure they are handled during shutdown.
- **How:** Use `asyncio.all_tasks()` to retrieve all active tasks and manage them accordingly.

  ```python
  async def shutdown():
      tasks = [task for task in asyncio.all_tasks() if task is not asyncio.current_task()]
      for task in tasks:
          task.cancel()
      await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
  ```

### 6. **Document Shutdown Procedures Clearly 📄📝**

- **Why:** To maintain code clarity and ensure that shutdown logic is understandable and maintainable.
- **How:** Comment your shutdown code and explain the reasoning behind task cancellation and resource cleanup.

  ```python
  async def main():
      server = await asyncio.start_server(handle_client, '127.0.0.1', 8888)
      async with server:
          try:
              await server.serve_forever()
          except asyncio.CancelledError:
              # Shutdown logic here
              pass
  ```


## 8. 🎉 **Conclusion**

Managing the lifecycle of asyncio applications—**starting up** and **shutting down gracefully**—is essential for building robust, efficient, and error-free asynchronous systems. By leveraging `asyncio.run()` for handling the event loop, properly cancelling and awaiting pending tasks, and adhering to best practices, you can ensure that your applications start and terminate smoothly without leaving behind dangling tasks or open resources.
