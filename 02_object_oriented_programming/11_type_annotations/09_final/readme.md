## üìñ Introduction to `Final`

The `Final` qualifier in Python‚Äôs `typing` module allows developers to declare variables that should not be reassigned, signaling to type checkers like `mypy` that these variables are constants. This is particularly useful for configuration values or constants that must remain unchanged throughout a program's execution.

By using `Final`, you can reduce the risk of accidental reassignments, providing better stability and predictability in your code. üêû

### Basic Example

Let's look at a simple example where we define an API endpoint as a `Final` variable to avoid unexpected changes.

```python
from typing import Final

API_ENDPOINT: Final = "https://api.example.com/v1/"

# Attempting to reassign `API_ENDPOINT` will raise an error with `mypy`
# API_ENDPOINT = "https://new-api.example.com"  # Type error with mypy
```

In the above example:
- `API_ENDPOINT` is declared as `Final`, indicating it should remain unchanged.
- Any attempt to reassign `API_ENDPOINT` will trigger a type error if checked with `mypy`.

**How `mypy` Reacts:** If you try to reassign `API_ENDPOINT` in the code, `mypy` will flag it, helping prevent accidental changes to critical variables.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Use Case: Application Configuration Constants

Consider a scenario where you have application-wide configuration constants that should not change once they are set, such as environment variables or API keys. Changing these values accidentally could disrupt the application‚Äôs operations, so it‚Äôs crucial to protect them.

### ü§î The Problem Statement

Imagine an application that connects to a database with specific configuration settings:

```python
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_PORT = 5432
DB_USER = "admin"
DB_PASSWORD = "securepassword"
```

In a large codebase, it‚Äôs easy for someone to accidentally reassign one of these variables, causing unexpected database connection failures. For example, if someone mistakenly changes `DB_HOST`, the application may connect to the wrong database. üò±

**Accidental Reassignment Example:**

```python
def connect_to_test_database():
    global DB_HOST
    DB_HOST = "test-db.example.com"  # Accidentally reassigning DB_HOST for a test database
    # Proceed with test connection...
```

This unintended reassignment impacts the entire application, leading to unexpected behavior elsewhere. üò¢

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementing `Final`

To prevent this from happening, we can declare these configuration variables as `Final`, signaling to `mypy` and other type checkers that these variables should not be reassigned.

```python
from typing import Final

DB_HOST: Final = "localhost"
DB_PORT: Final = 5432
DB_USER: Final = "admin"
DB_PASSWORD: Final = "securepassword"
```

In this implementation:
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` are marked as `Final`, indicating that their values should remain constant throughout the program.

If someone tries to reassign `DB_HOST`, `mypy` will raise an error, providing an early warning of potential issues.

### üöß Enforcing Immutability with `mypy`

When you use `Final` with `mypy`, any attempt to change a `Final` variable will result in a type-checking error, alerting developers of the mistake.

```python
def connect_to_test_database():
    global DB_HOST
    DB_HOST = "test-db.example.com"  # Type error: Cannot assign to final name "DB_HOST"
    # Proceed with test connection...
```

**Expected `mypy` Error Message:**

```
error: Cannot assign to final name "DB_HOST"
```

This error makes it clear that `DB_HOST` is immutable, ensuring that the original configuration remains unaltered throughout the application.

### Complete Example: Using `Final` with Database Configuration

Here‚Äôs a full example showing how `Final` prevents accidental reassignment of configuration variables.

```python
from typing import Final

# Declare database configuration constants
DB_HOST: Final = "localhost"
DB_PORT: Final = 5432
DB_USER: Final = "admin"
DB_PASSWORD: Final = "securepassword"

def connect_to_test_database():
    global DB_HOST
    DB_HOST = "test-db.example.com"  # Type error: Cannot assign to final name "DB_HOST"
    # Proceed with test connection...

# Example of a normal function using the constants without reassigning
def connect_to_database():
    print(f"Connecting to database at {DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT} with user {DB_USER}")
```

If you try to reassign `DB_HOST` in `connect_to_test_database`, `mypy` will raise the error, ensuring the configuration constants remain stable.

## üåü Best Practices

To maximize the benefits of `Final` in your code, follow these best practices:

1. **Use `Final` for Constants**: Apply `Final` to variables that represent constants or configuration values that should not change after initialization.

   ```python
   MAX_CONNECTIONS: Final = 100
   TIMEOUT_SECONDS: Final = 30
   ```

2. **Module-Level Variables**: `Final` is particularly useful for module-level variables that are accessed widely across the codebase.

3. **Document Intentions**: Add comments explaining why a variable is declared as `Final`, helping other developers understand its importance and purpose.

   ```python
   MAX_USERS: Final = 1000  # Do not change: critical for license compliance
   ```

4. **Immutability for Readability**: Declaring variables as `Final` can make the code clearer by explicitly defining which variables are intended to be constants, making the code easier to read and maintain.

## üìù Important Notes

### Mutation vs. Reassignment

Using `Final` prevents the reassignment of the variable itself, but it **does not** prevent mutation of the object it refers to if the object is mutable.

**Example with a Mutable Object:**

```python
from typing import Final

# `CONFIG` is marked as `Final`, meaning it cannot be reassigned
CONFIG: Final = {"debug": False, "version": "1.0"}

# Allowed: Mutating the object itself is permitted
CONFIG["debug"] = True  # This is allowed, as it modifies the internal state of the object

# Not Allowed: Reassigning the `CONFIG` variable itself
# CONFIG = {"debug": True, "version": "1.1"}  # Type error with mypy
```

**Explanation:**
- `Final` prevents reassigning `CONFIG`, but since `CONFIG` is a dictionary (a mutable object), its contents can still be changed.
- For truly immutable configurations, use immutable types like `tuple` or `frozenset`, or create custom classes to prevent internal mutation.

### Example of True Immutability

To prevent mutation of the configuration, we can use `tuple` instead of `dict`:

```python
from typing import Final, Tuple

# Using a tuple for true immutability
CONFIG: Final[Tuple[str, str]] = ("debug_mode_off", "version_1.0")

# Attempting to change CONFIG or its content will raise an error with `mypy`
# CONFIG[0] = "debug_mode_on"  # Type error: Tuples are immutable
```

Using immutable types like `tuple` or custom classes with `Final` ensures that both the variable and its content remain unchangeable.

## üéØ Conclusion

Using `Final` in Python 3.12 allows you to safeguard critical constants and configuration values, enhancing code robustness and reducing potential bugs from accidental reassignment. It‚Äôs a simple but powerful tool that contributes to more stable, predictable code, especially in large applications where variables are shared across multiple modules. üí°

**Key Takeaways:**
- Use `Final` for constants and values that shouldn‚Äôt be changed after initialization.
- `mypy` will raise type errors if a `Final` variable is reassigned, providing early warnings to prevent bugs.
- Remember, `Final` stops reassignment but not mutation; for true immutability, use immutable data structures.
