## **Introduction** 🏁

Type annotations allow you to specify **what types of data** a function expects for its parameters and what it will return. This makes it **easier to understand the code**, helps prevent errors, and provides more **robust code** by catching issues early.

Type annotations do **not** affect how the code runs; they are just hints to **help developers** (and tools) understand the code better.


## **Benefits of Type Annotations** 🏷️

### **1. Autocomplete** 🔍✨

When you use type annotations, many Python-aware editors (like **VS Code**) can **autocomplete** methods and properties based on the types you’ve specified. This speeds up coding and reduces mistakes.

**Example:**
Let's say you have a function that schedules workers at a restaurant based on a specific time:
```python
from datetime import datetime
import random

# Function with type annotations
def schedule_restaurant_open(open_time: datetime, workers_needed: int) -> None:
    workers = find_workers_available_for_time(open_time)
    for worker in random.sample(workers, workers_needed):
        print(f"Scheduled {worker} to work at {open_time}.")

# Helper function
def find_workers_available_for_time(open_time: datetime) -> list[str]:
    return ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Function call
schedule_restaurant_open(datetime.now(), 2)
```

**What happens here:**
- You declare that `open_time` should be a `datetime`, and `workers_needed` should be an `int`.
- Your editor can **suggest** available methods and properties based on `datetime`, which helps you write code **faster** and with fewer errors.

### **2. Typecheckers** 🛡️

Type annotations are just hints, but **typecheckers** like **`mypy`** can analyze your code and **catch potential issues** where your usage doesn’t match the annotations.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install mypy
```

**Example:**
Imagine you have a file called `example.py`:
```python
a: int = 5
a = "hello"  # This will cause an error because `a` should be an `int`
```

Run `mypy` to check for errors:
```bash
mypy example.py
# Output:
# example.py:2: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "str", variable has type "int")
```

**Why it’s helpful:** You catch errors **before** running the program. It saves you **debugging time** later on.


## **Exercise: Spot the Bug** 🔍🐞

Here are some examples where typecheckers can catch bugs. Let’s see if you can spot the issues! 💡
## 📌 Overview
This script demonstrates an **encoding mismatch** when reading an **ISO-8859-1 encoded** file as **UTF-8**, causing a **UnicodeDecodeError**.

## 🔍 Issue
- **File written in ISO-8859-1**.
- **Read as UTF-8**, causing decoding failure.

## 📝 Code
### **Incorrect Approach** (Raises Error)
```python
with open("example.txt", "w", encoding="iso-8859-1") as f:
    f.write("Héllo Wørld! ñ ü ß")

def read_file(filename):
    with open(filename, "rb") as f:
        return f.read().decode("utf-8")[::-1]  # ❌ Error
print(read_file("example.txt"))
```
🚨 **Error:**
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe9...
```

## ✅ **Solution**
Use the correct encoding:
```python
with open("example.txt", "r", encoding="iso-8859-1") as f:
    print(f.read()[::-1])  # ✅ Correct
```

### **Example 2: Doubling Values in a List**
**Incorrect Code:**
```python
# Function to double values and add to the list
def add_doubled_values(my_list: list[int]) -> None:
    my_list.extend([x * 2 for x in my_list])  # Correct method: extend

# Function call
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
add_doubled_values(numbers)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6]
```

**Explanation:**
The earlier code incorrectly used `.update()`, which is for sets. **Lists use `.extend()`** to add multiple values.

### **Example 3: Returning Restaurant Name**
**Incorrect Code:**
```python
from typing import Optional

# Function to return restaurant name based on city
def get_restaurant_name(city: str) -> Optional[str]:
    if city in ["Rome", "Milan"]:
        return "Trattoria Viafore"
    if city in ["Berlin", "Munich"]:
        return "Pat's Kantine"
    if city in ["New York", "Boston"]:
        return "Pat's Place"
    return None

# Function call
result = get_restaurant_name("Boston")
if result:
    print(f"Location Found: {result}")
```

**Explanation:**
If the city isn’t in the list, the function returns `None`. By specifying `Optional[str]`, we make it clear that the function might **not always** return a string.


## **Additional Examples of Type Annotation Benefits** 🧩

### **Example 4: Data Processing**
```python
from datetime import datetime

def filter_dates(dates: list[datetime], year: int) -> list[datetime]:
    return [date for date in dates if date.year == year]

# Example usage:
dates = [datetime(2021, 6, 24), datetime(2022, 7, 19), datetime(2021, 12, 31)]
filtered_dates = filter_dates(dates, 2021)
print(filtered_dates)
```

### **Example 5: Web API Response Parsing**
```python
def parse_response(data: dict[str, int | str]) -> str:
    return f"Processed ID: {data.get('id')} - Name: {data.get('name')}"

# Function call example
response = {"id": 101, "name": "John Doe"}
print(parse_response(response))
```

**Explanation:** 
The `|` operator allows specifying multiple types (`str` or `int`), which is a new feature in Python 3.10 and later.


## **When to Use Type Annotations** 🧠

Here are some suggestions:
- **Public APIs & Libraries:** Makes it clearer for anyone using your functions.
- **Complex or Confusing Types:** Helps avoid misunderstandings.
- **Whenever Typecheckers Require It:** Following typechecker suggestions keeps your code **consistent** and **error-free**.


## **Conclusion** 🏁

Type annotations make your code **cleaner**, **easier to understand**, and **more robust**. They allow for **better collaboration**, faster **coding**, and early error detection using **typecheckers**. By adopting type annotations, you can create a **smoother development experience** and **avoid many common pitfalls**. 🐍🚀
