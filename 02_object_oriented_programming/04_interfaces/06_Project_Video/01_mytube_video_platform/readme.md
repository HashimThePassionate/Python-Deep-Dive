This code exhibits tight coupling because of the direct dependencies between classes without abstraction layers or interfaces. Tight coupling occurs when classes are highly dependent on each other and changes in one class require corresponding changes in other classes. Here's how the code demonstrates tight coupling:

1. **Direct Class Instantiation**: In the `VideoProcessor` class, instances of `VideoEncoder`, `VideoDatabase`, and `EmailService` are directly instantiated using the `VideoProcessor` class. This means `VideoProcessor` is tightly coupled to these concrete classes, making it difficult to replace them or extend functionality without modifying `VideoProcessor`.

2. **Dependency in Method Calls**: In the `VideoProcessor` class, the `process` method directly calls methods from `VideoEncoder`, `VideoDatabase`, and `EmailService` classes. This directly couples `VideoProcessor` to specific implementations of these functionalities, making it less flexible and harder to maintain.

3. **Getter and Setter Methods**: The `Video` class exposes getter and setter methods for its properties (`file_name`, `title`, `user`). While not inherently bad, these methods can contribute to tight coupling if multiple classes access and modify the internal state of `Video` directly.

4. **Concrete Class Dependencies**: `VideoProcessor` directly depends on concrete implementations of `VideoEncoder`, `VideoDatabase`, and `EmailService`. If we want to change any of these dependencies or add new ones, we would need to modify the `VideoProcessor` class, violating the Open/Closed Principle.

To reduce coupling and increase flexibility, we could introduce abstractions such as interfaces or abstract classes, and use dependency injection to provide implementations at runtime. This way, classes would depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, allowing for easier changes and extensions without modifying existing code.
