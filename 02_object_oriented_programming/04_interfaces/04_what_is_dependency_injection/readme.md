### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement Inversion of Control (IoC) where the control of creating and managing dependencies is moved from within a class to an external entity. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, they are provided to it, usually by an external container or framework.

### Why is Dependency Injection Important?

1. **Decoupling**: DI promotes loose coupling between classes. Classes are not responsible for creating their dependencies, making it easier to change and manage them.
2. **Testability**: DI makes it easier to test classes in isolation by injecting mock dependencies during unit testing.
3. **Flexibility**: It allows for easier swapping of implementations without changing the dependent class.
4. **Maintainability**: With DI, it's easier to manage and maintain complex applications as dependencies are managed centrally.

### Types of Dependency Injection

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. **Setter Injection**: Dependencies are provided through setter methods.
3. **Interface Injection**: The dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it.
