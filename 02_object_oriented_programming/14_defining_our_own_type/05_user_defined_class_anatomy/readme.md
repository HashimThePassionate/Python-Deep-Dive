## 🔹 Introduction to Classes

Classes in Python are fundamental building blocks of object-oriented programming (OOP). They allow you to group related data and behaviors together, creating **blueprints** for objects.

### **Basic Class Definition**

```python
class Person:
    name: str = ""
    years_experience: int = 0
    address: str = ""
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Defining the Class:**
    ```python
    class Person:
    ```
    - **`class Person`:** This line defines a new class named `Person`.

2. **Class Attributes:**
    ```python
    name: str = ""
    years_experience: int = 0
    address: str = ""
    ```
    - **`name: str = ""`:** Defines an attribute `name` of type `str` with a default value of an empty string.
    - **`years_experience: int = 0`:** Defines an attribute `years_experience` of type `int` with a default value of `0`.
    - **`address: str = ""`:** Defines an attribute `address` of type `str` with a default value of an empty string.

### **Instantiation and Usage**

```python
pat = Person()
pat.name = "Pat"
print(f"Hello {pat.name}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Creating an Instance:**
    ```python
    pat = Person()
    ```
    - **`pat = Person()`:** Creates a new instance of the `Person` class and assigns it to the variable `pat`.

2. **Setting Attributes:**
    ```python
    pat.name = "Pat"
    ```
    - **`pat.name = "Pat"`:** Sets the `name` attribute of the `pat` instance to `"Pat"`.

3. **Printing Attributes:**
    ```python
    print(f"Hello {pat.name}")
    ```
    - **`print(f"Hello {pat.name}")`:** Outputs the string `"Hello Pat"` by accessing the `name` attribute of `pat`.

### **Comparison with Dictionaries and Data Classes**

You can achieve similar functionality using dictionaries or data classes, but each approach has its pros and cons.

#### **Using a Dictionary**

```python
pat = {
    "name": "",
    "years_experience": 0,
    "address": ""
}
```

**Pros:**
- **Flexibility:** Easily add or remove key-value pairs.
- **No Class Definition Needed:** Quick to set up without formal structure.

**Cons:**
- **Lack of Type Safety:** Keys and values can be of any type, leading to potential errors.
- **No Methods:** Cannot encapsulate behaviors related to the data.
- **Less Readable:** Without explicit structure, it's harder to understand what data the dictionary holds.

#### **Using a Data Class**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str = ""
    years_experience: int = 0
    address: str = ""
```

**Pros:**
- **Type Safety:** Enforces types for each field.
- **Automatic Method Generation:** Generates methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.
- **Readability:** Clearly defines what data the class holds.

**Cons:**
- **Less Flexible Than Dictionaries:** Adding or removing fields requires modifying the class definition.
- **Requires Python 3.7+:** Data classes are available from Python 3.7 onwards.


## 🛠️ Constructors (`__init__`)

A **constructor** in Python is a special method named `__init__` that initializes a new instance of a class. It defines how an object is created and what initial values its attributes should have.

### **Why Define a Constructor?**

While data classes automatically generate constructors, regular classes require you to define them explicitly. This provides more control over how instances are initialized and allows you to enforce invariants (rules that must always hold true for an object).

### **Defining a Constructor**

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name: str, years_experience: int, address: str):
        self.name = name
        self.years_experience = years_experience
        self.address = address
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Constructor Definition:**
    ```python
    def __init__(self, name: str, years_experience: int, address: str):
    ```
    - **`def __init__`:** Defines the constructor method.
    - **`self`:** Represents the instance being created.
    - **Parameters:** `name`, `years_experience`, and `address` are required to instantiate a `Person`.

2. **Initializing Attributes:**
    ```python
    self.name = name
    self.years_experience = years_experience
    self.address = address
    ```
    - **`self.name = name`:** Assigns the passed `name` to the instance's `name` attribute.
    - **`self.years_experience = years_experience`:** Assigns the passed `years_experience`.
    - **`self.address = address`:** Assigns the passed `address`.

### **Instantiation with Constructor**

```python
pat = Person("Pat", 13, "123 Fake St.")
```

**Explanation:**

- **`pat = Person("Pat", 13, "123 Fake St.")`:** Creates a new `Person` instance with `name="Pat"`, `years_experience=13`, and `address="123 Fake St."`.

### **Error Without Constructor**

Attempting to instantiate a class without defining a constructor will result in an error when you try to pass arguments:

```python
class Person:
    name: str = ""
    years_experience: int = 0
    address: str = ""

pat = Person("Pat", 13, "123 Fake St.")
```

**Error:**
```
TypeError: Person() takes no arguments
```

**Explanation:**

- Without an explicitly defined `__init__` method, Python does not know how to handle the arguments passed during instantiation, leading to a `TypeError`.


## 🔗 Invariants

### **What Are Invariants?**

An **invariant** is a property or condition that remains true throughout the lifetime of an object. Invariants are crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of your objects.

**Real-World Examples of Invariants:**
- **Unique Employee IDs:** Every employee must have a unique identifier.
- **Positive Radius:** A circle must always have a positive radius.
- **Single Sauce in Pizza:** A pizza can have at most one sauce.

### **Why Are Invariants Important?**

Invariants ensure that objects remain in a valid state, preventing bugs and inconsistencies. By enforcing invariants, you make your code more robust and easier to maintain.

### **Implementing Invariants in Classes**

Let's consider an example involving an automated pizza maker that must adhere to specific rules (invariants) when creating pizzas.

#### **PizzaSpecification Class with Invariants**

```python
from pizza.sauces import is_sauce

class PizzaSpecification:
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
        assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
        sauces = [t for t in toppings if is_sauce(t)]
        assert len(sauces) < 2, 'Can only have at most one sauce'
        self.dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
        sauce = sauces[:1]
        self.toppings = sauce + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Importing Dependencies:**
    ```python
    from pizza.sauces import is_sauce
    ```
    - **`is_sauce`:** A function that determines if a topping is a sauce.

2. **Class Definition:**
    ```python
    class PizzaSpecification:
    ```
    - Defines a class `PizzaSpecification` to encapsulate pizza-related data and rules.

3. **Constructor with Invariants:**
    ```python
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
    ```
    - **Parameters:**
        - `dough_radius_in_inches`: Radius of the pizza dough in inches.
        - `toppings`: A list of toppings on the pizza.

4. **Asserting Dough Radius:**
    ```python
    assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
    ```
    - Ensures that the dough radius is between 6 and 12 inches. If not, an `AssertionError` is raised with the message `'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'`.

5. **Identifying Sauces:**
    ```python
    sauces = [t for t in toppings if is_sauce(t)]
    ```
    - **List Comprehension:** Creates a list of toppings that are identified as sauces using the `is_sauce` function.

6. **Asserting Number of Sauces:**
    ```python
    assert len(sauces) < 2, 'Can only have at most one sauce'
    ```
    - Ensures that there is at most one sauce. If more than one sauce is found, raises an `AssertionError` with the message `'Can only have at most one sauce'`.

7. **Initializing Attributes:**
    ```python
    self.dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
    sauce = sauces[:1]
    self.toppings = sauce + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]
    ```
    - **`self.dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches`:** Assigns the validated dough radius.
    - **`sauce = sauces[:1]`:** Takes the first sauce (if any) from the sauces list.
    - **`self.toppings`:** Combines the first sauce (if present) with the remaining non-sauce toppings.

### **Benefits of Using Invariants:**

1. **Data Integrity:** Ensures that the object always remains in a valid state.
2. **Error Prevention:** Catches invalid data early, preventing bugs down the line.
3. **Clear Contract:** Defines clear rules for how objects should be constructed and used.


## ⚖️ Assertions vs. Exceptions

### **Assertions**

**Assertions** are statements that assert a condition must be true at a specific point in the code. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.

**Characteristics:**
- **Used for Debugging:** Primarily used to catch developer errors during development.
- **Can Be Disabled:** Assertions can be globally disabled with the `-O` (optimize) flag when running Python, making them unsuitable for enforcing runtime invariants in production.
- **Syntax:**
    ```python
    assert condition, "Error message"
    ```

**Example:**

```python
def set_age(age: int):
    assert age > 0, "Age must be positive"
    # Proceed with setting the age
```

**When to Use:**
- **Internal Consistency Checks:** Ensuring that the program logic is correct during development.
- **Non-Essential Checks:** Conditions that should always be true unless there's a bug.

### **Exceptions**

**Exceptions** are errors that occur during the execution of a program. They can be caught and handled using `try-except` blocks.

**Characteristics:**
- **Used for Runtime Errors:** Handle situations that may occur during normal operation, such as user input errors or network issues.
- **Cannot Be Disabled:** Always active, ensuring that critical errors are handled.
- **Syntax:**
    ```python
    if not condition:
        raise SomeException("Error message")
    ```

**Example:**

```python
def set_age(age: int):
    if age <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Age must be positive")
    # Proceed with setting the age
```

**When to Use:**
- **User Input Validation:** Handling incorrect data provided by users.
- **External Conditions:** Dealing with issues like file not found, network failures, etc.
- **Critical Invariants:** Conditions that must always hold true, even in production.

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature          | Assertions                        | Exceptions                       |
---|
| **Purpose**      | Debugging and developer checks    | Handling runtime errors          |
| **Disablable**   | Yes, with `-O` flag                | No                               |
| **Use Case**     | Internal consistency              | External error handling          |
| **Error Type**   | `AssertionError`                   | Various (`ValueError`, `TypeError`, etc.) |

### **Best Practices:**

- **Use Assertions for:**
  - Checking internal assumptions.
  - Validating invariants during development.
  
- **Use Exceptions for:**
  - Handling user input errors.
  - Managing external system errors.
  - Enforcing critical invariants that must hold in production.


## 🚫 Avoiding Broken Invariants

Maintaining invariants is crucial for ensuring that objects remain in a valid state throughout their lifecycle. However, it's essential to prevent scenarios where invariants can be broken, either intentionally or accidentally.

### **Two Approaches to Handle Potential Invariant Violations:**

1. **Throw an Exception:**
    - **Description:** Prevent the object from being created if invariants are violated by raising an exception.
    - **When to Use:** When invalid data should never be allowed to create an object.
    
    **Example:**

    ```python
    class PizzaException(Exception):
        pass

    class PizzaSpecification:
        def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
            if not (6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12):
                raise PizzaException('Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches')
            sauces = [t for t in toppings if is_sauce(t)]
            if len(sauces) >= 2:
                raise PizzaException('Can only have at most one sauce')
            self.dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
            sauce = sauces[:1]
            self.toppings = sauce + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]
    ```

2. **Massage the Data:**
    - **Description:** Modify or adjust the data to conform to invariants automatically.
    - **When to Use:** When minor adjustments can be made to the data to maintain invariants without requiring external intervention.
    
    **Example:**

    ```python
    class PizzaSpecification:
        def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
            self.dough_radius_in_inches = max(6, min(dough_radius_in_inches, 12))
            sauces = [t for t in toppings if is_sauce(t)]
            if len(sauces) >= 2:
                sauces = sauces[:1]  # Keep only the first sauce
            self.toppings = sauces + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]
    ```

### **Choosing Between Exceptions and Massaging Data:**

- **Use Exceptions When:**
  - Invalid data indicates a critical error that should not be silently corrected.
  - You want to alert the caller that their input is incorrect.
  
- **Massage the Data When:**
  - Minor adjustments can be made without affecting the overall functionality.
  - You prefer to handle inconsistencies internally without burdening the caller.

### **When to Use Each Approach:**

- **Throwing Exceptions:**
  - When invariants are critical and must never be violated.
  - When invalid data represents a misuse of the API or a critical failure.

- **Massaging Data:**
  - When minor corrections can be safely applied.
  - When the system can recover gracefully from minor inconsistencies.


## 🔒 Encapsulation and Maintaining Invariants

### **What is Encapsulation?**

**Encapsulation** is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming. It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is essential for maintaining invariants.

### **Benefits of Encapsulation:**

1. **Data Hiding:**
    - Prevents external code from directly modifying internal states.
    - Protects invariants by controlling how data is accessed and modified.

2. **Modularity:**
    - Encourages separation of concerns by grouping related data and behaviors.
    - Makes code more organized and manageable.

3. **Maintainability:**
    - Changes to the internal implementation do not affect external code.
    - Reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

### **Access Control in Python:**

Python does not enforce strict access controls like some other languages (e.g., `private` in Java). Instead, it relies on **naming conventions** to indicate the intended level of access.

#### **Types of Access Control:**

1. **Public:**
    - Accessible from anywhere.
    - No underscores in the attribute name.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        public_attr: str = "I am public"
    ```

2. **Protected:**
    - Intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.
    - Prefixed with a single underscore `_`.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        _protected_attr: str = "I am protected"
    ```

3. **Private:**
    - Intended for internal use only within the class.
    - Prefixed with double underscores `__`.
    - Python performs **name mangling** to make it harder to access from outside.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        __private_attr: str = "I am private"
    ```

### **Example: Encapsulating Attributes**

```python
class PizzaSpecification:
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
        assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
        sauces = [t for t in toppings if is_sauce(t)]
        assert len(sauces) < 2, 'Can have at most one sauce'
        self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches  # Private attribute
        sauce = sauces[:1]
        self.__toppings = sauce + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]  # Private attribute
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Private Attributes:**
    ```python
    self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
    self.__toppings = sauce + [t for t in toppings if not is_sauce(t)]
    ```
    - **Double Underscores (`__`):** Indicate that these attributes are private.
    - **Name Mangling:** Python internally renames these attributes to `_PizzaSpecification__dough_radius_in_inches` and `_PizzaSpecification__toppings` to prevent accidental access.

2. **Attempting to Access Private Attributes:**
    ```python
    pizza_spec = PizzaSpecification(dough_radius_in_inches=8, toppings=['Olive Oil', 'Garlic', 'Sliced Roma Tomatoes', 'Mozzarella'])
    pizza_spec.__toppings.append('Tomato Sauce')  # Raises AttributeError
    ```
    
    **Error:**
    ```
    AttributeError: type object 'PizzaSpecification' has no attribute '__toppings'
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - Attempting to access `__toppings` directly raises an `AttributeError` because it's a private attribute.

3. **Name Mangling Demonstration:**
    ```python
    print(pizza_spec.__dict__)
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    ```
    {
        '_PizzaSpecification__toppings': ['Olive Oil', 'Garlic', 'Sliced Roma Tomatoes', 'Mozzarella'],
        '_PizzaSpecification__dough_radius_in_inches': 8
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - The private attributes are internally stored with mangled names, making it clear when someone attempts to access or modify them improperly.

4. **Force Accessing Private Attributes (Not Recommended):**
    ```python
    pizza_spec._PizzaSpecification__dough_radius_in_inches = 100
    print(pizza_spec._PizzaSpecification__dough_radius_in_inches)
    ```
    
    **Output:**
    ```
    100
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    - While possible, directly accessing mangled names breaks encapsulation and can lead to broken invariants. This should be avoided.

### **Setting Up Access Control:**

- **Public Attributes:**
    - Accessible and modifiable from anywhere.
    
- **Protected Attributes:**
    - Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
    - Conventionally accessed by prefixing with a single underscore.
    
- **Private Attributes:**
    - Intended to be inaccessible from outside the class.
    - Use double underscores to trigger name mangling.
    
**Note:** Python's access control is **convention-based**, relying on developers to respect the intended levels of access. There are no strict enforcement mechanisms.


## 📜 Getters and Setters

### **What Are Getters and Setters?**

**Getters** and **setters** are methods used to **access** and **modify** the attributes of a class, respectively. They provide a controlled way of interacting with an object's data, ensuring that invariants are maintained.

### **Why Use Getters and Setters?**

- **Encapsulation:** Hide the internal representation of the data.
- **Validation:** Ensure that any changes to the data adhere to invariants.
- **Flexibility:** Allow changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code.

### **Common Mistakes: Overusing Getters and Setters**

Creating a getter and setter for every attribute can lead to boilerplate code and may defeat the purpose of encapsulation if not used thoughtfully. Instead, focus on providing methods that align with the class's responsibilities.

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Provide Only Necessary Methods:**
    - Don't create getters and setters unless you need to enforce invariants or add additional logic.

2. **Avoid Returning References to Mutable Attributes:**
    - If an attribute is mutable (like a list or dictionary), consider returning a copy to prevent external modifications.

3. **Encapsulate Behavior:**
    - Instead of exposing attributes, provide methods that perform necessary operations while maintaining invariants.

### **Example: Adding a Topping with Validation**

```python
from typing import List
from pizza.exceptions import PizzaException
from pizza.sauces import is_sauce

class PizzaSpecification:
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
        assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
        self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
        self.__toppings: list[str] = []
        for topping in toppings:
            self.add_topping(topping)
    
    def add_topping(self, topping: str):
        '''
        Add a topping to the pizza.
        Ensures that:
        - Only one sauce is present.
        - Sauce is always the first topping.
        '''
        if is_sauce(topping) and any(t for t in self.__toppings if is_sauce(t)):
            raise PizzaException('Pizza may only have one sauce')
        if is_sauce(topping):
            self.__toppings.insert(0, topping)  # Add sauce at the beginning
        else:
            self.__toppings.append(topping)  # Add other toppings at the end
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Private Attributes:**
    ```python
    self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
    self.__toppings: list[str] = []
    ```
    - **`__dough_radius_in_inches`:** Private attribute for dough radius.
    - **`__toppings`:** Private list to store toppings.

2. **Adding Toppings with Validation:**
    ```python
    def add_topping(self, topping: str):
    ```
    - **Method Purpose:** Adds a topping to the pizza while enforcing invariants.

3. **Enforcing Single Sauce Invariant:**
    ```python
    if is_sauce(topping) and any(t for t in self.__toppings if is_sauce(t)):
        raise PizzaException('Pizza may only have one sauce')
    ```
    - **Check:** If the new topping is a sauce and there's already a sauce in the toppings, raise an exception.

4. **Adding Sauce as First Topping:**
    ```python
    if is_sauce(topping):
        self.__toppings.insert(0, topping)  # Add sauce at the beginning
    else:
        self.__toppings.append(topping)  # Add other toppings at the end
    ```
    - **Sauce:** Insert at the beginning of the toppings list.
    - **Other Toppings:** Append to the end of the list.

### **Using the `add_topping` Method**

```python
# Creating a PizzaSpecification instance
pizza_spec = PizzaSpecification(8, ["Olive Oil", "Garlic", "Sliced Roma Tomatoes", "Mozzarella"])

# Attempting to add another sauce
try:
    pizza_spec.add_topping("Tomato Sauce")
except PizzaException as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Pizza may only have one sauce
```

**Explanation:**

- **Adding a Valid Topping:**
    - `"Olive Oil"`, `"Garlic"`, etc., are added without issues.
    
- **Attempting to Add a Second Sauce:**
    - Raises `PizzaException` because only one sauce is allowed.


## 🔧 Operations: Methods Inside Classes

### **What Are Methods?**

**Methods** are functions defined within a class that operate on instances of that class. They can **access** and **modify** the instance's attributes, encapsulating behaviors related to the data.

### **Types of Methods:**

1. **Instance Methods:**
    - Operate on an instance of the class.
    - Have access to `self`.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        def instance_method(self):
            pass
    ```

2. **Class Methods:**
    - Operate on the class itself, not instances.
    - Use the `@classmethod` decorator and have access to `cls`.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        @classmethod
        def class_method(cls):
            pass
    ```

3. **Static Methods:**
    - Do not operate on class or instance.
    - Use the `@staticmethod` decorator.
    
    ```python
    class Example:
        @staticmethod
        def static_method():
            pass
    ```

**Note:** We'll discuss `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` in more detail later.

### **Encapsulating Operations Within Classes**

Let's revisit the `PizzaSpecification` class to see how methods can encapsulate operations while maintaining invariants.

#### **Example: Adding a Topping**

```python
from typing import List
from pizza.exceptions import PizzaException
from pizza.sauces import is_sauce

class PizzaSpecification:
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
        assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
        self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
        self.__toppings: list[str] = []
        for topping in toppings:
            self.add_topping(topping)
    
    def add_topping(self, topping: str):
        '''
        Add a topping to the pizza.
        Ensures that:
        - Only one sauce is present.
        - Sauce is always the first topping.
        '''
        if is_sauce(topping) and any(t for t in self.__toppings if is_sauce(t)):
            raise PizzaException('Pizza may only have one sauce')
        if is_sauce(topping):
            self.__toppings.insert(0, topping)  # Add sauce at the beginning
        else:
            self.__toppings.append(topping)  # Add other toppings at the end
```

**Explanation:**

1. **`add_topping` Method:**
    - **Purpose:** Adds a topping while ensuring that only one sauce is present and that the sauce is the first topping.
    - **Invariant Enforcement:**
        - Checks if the new topping is a sauce and if a sauce already exists.
        - Raises an exception if more than one sauce is detected.
        - Ensures sauces are added at the beginning of the toppings list.

### **Advantages of Encapsulating Operations:**

1. **Invariant Maintenance:** Ensures that any modifications to the data adhere to the defined rules.
2. **Code Reusability:** Encapsulated methods can be reused across different instances without redundancy.
3. **Enhanced Readability:** Clear methods make the code easier to understand and maintain.
4. **Controlled Access:** Restricts how data is modified, preventing accidental or malicious changes.

### **Real-World Scenario: Automated Pizza Maker**

Imagine you're developing an automated pizza maker system. You need to ensure that pizzas are constructed correctly according to specific rules (invariants).

#### **Defining the `PizzaSpecification` Class**

```python
from typing import List
from pizza.exceptions import PizzaException
from pizza.sauces import is_sauce

class PizzaSpecification:
    def __init__(self, dough_radius_in_inches: int, toppings: list[str]):
        assert 6 <= dough_radius_in_inches <= 12, 'Dough must be between 6 and 12 inches'
        self.__dough_radius_in_inches = dough_radius_in_inches
        self.__toppings: list[str] = []
        for topping in toppings:
            self.add_topping(topping)
    
    def add_topping(self, topping: str):
        '''
        Add a topping to the pizza.
        Ensures that:
        - Only one sauce is present.
        - Sauce is always the first topping.
        '''
        if is_sauce(topping) and any(t for t in self.__toppings if is_sauce(t)):
            raise PizzaException('Pizza may only have one sauce')
        if is_sauce(topping):
            self.__toppings.insert(0, topping)  # Add sauce at the beginning
        else:
            self.__toppings.append(topping)  # Add other toppings at the end
    
    def remove_topping(self, topping: str):
        '''
        Remove a topping from the pizza.
        '''
        try:
            self.__toppings.remove(topping)
        except ValueError:
            raise PizzaException(f"Topping '{topping}' not found on the pizza")
    
    def get_toppings(self) -> List[str]:
        '''
        Retrieve the list of toppings.
        '''
        return self.__toppings.copy()
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"PizzaSpecification(radius={self.__dough_radius_in_inches}, toppings={self.__toppings})"
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Constructor (`__init__`):**
    - Validates dough radius.
    - Initializes private attributes.
    - Adds initial toppings using the `add_topping` method to enforce invariants.

2. **`add_topping` Method:**
    - Adds a topping while ensuring only one sauce is present.
    - Inserts sauces at the beginning of the toppings list.

3. **`remove_topping` Method:**
    - Removes a specified topping.
    - Raises an exception if the topping is not found.

4. **`get_toppings` Method:**
    - Returns a copy of the toppings list to prevent external modifications.

5. **`__str__` Method:**
    - Provides a readable string representation of the pizza specification.

### **Using the `PizzaSpecification` Class**

```python
# Creating a PizzaSpecification instance
pizza_spec = PizzaSpecification(8, ["Olive Oil", "Garlic", "Sliced Roma Tomatoes", "Mozzarella"])

# Adding a topping
pizza_spec.add_topping("Tomato Sauce")  # Raises PizzaException if more than one sauce

# Removing a topping
pizza_spec.remove_topping("Garlic")

# Retrieving toppings
toppings = pizza_spec.get_toppings()
print(toppings)  # Output: ['Tomato Sauce', 'Olive Oil', 'Sliced Roma Tomatoes', 'Mozzarella']

# Printing the pizza specification
print(pizza_spec)  # Output: PizzaSpecification(radius=8, toppings=['Tomato Sauce', 'Olive Oil', 'Sliced Roma Tomatoes', 'Mozzarella'])
```

**Explanation:**

- **Adding Toppings:**
    - Ensures that only one sauce is present and places it first.
  
- **Removing Toppings:**
    - Safely removes a topping, raising an exception if the topping doesn't exist.

- **Retrieving Toppings:**
    - Provides a copy to prevent external modifications.

- **Printing the Specification:**
    - Displays a clear, readable summary of the pizza.


## 🛑 `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`

### **What Are `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?**

In Python, `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` are decorators that define different types of methods within a class. They serve specific purposes and provide alternative ways to interact with class data.

### **1. `@staticmethod`**

**Definition:**
A **static method** is a method that belongs to a class but does not have access to the instance (`self`) or class (`cls`) variables. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace.

**When to Use:**
- When you need a utility function that performs a task related to the class but doesn't need to access or modify class or instance data.
- When the method's logic is related to the class's functionality but doesn't require any data from the class.

**Example:**

```python
class MathUtilities:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        return a + b

# Usage
result = MathUtilities.add(5, 7)
print(result)  # Output: 12
```

**Explanation:**

- **`@staticmethod`:** Decorates the `add` method to indicate it doesn't depend on class or instance data.
- **Usage:** Called directly on the class without needing to instantiate it.

### **2. `@classmethod`**

**Definition:**
A **class method** is a method that belongs to the class and has access to the class itself (`cls`). It can modify class state that applies across all instances.

**When to Use:**
- When you need to access or modify class-level data.
- When creating alternative constructors or factory methods.

**Example:**

```python
class Person:
    population = 0  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        Person.population += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_population(cls) -> int:
        return cls.population

# Usage
person1 = Person("Hashim")
person2 = Person("Bob")
print(Person.get_population())  # Output: 2
```

**Explanation:**

- **`@classmethod`:** Decorates the `get_population` method to indicate it has access to the class (`cls`).
- **Usage:** Called on the class to retrieve the `population` count.

### **Why Avoid Overusing `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?**

While these decorators provide flexibility, overusing them can lead to:

- **Reduced Encapsulation:** Methods that don't interact with class or instance data may not belong within the class.
- **Maintenance Challenges:** Utility functions might be better placed as free functions at the module level for better organization and reusability.
- **Complexity:** Introducing unnecessary decorators can complicate the class structure without tangible benefits.

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Use `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` Sparingly:**
    - Only when the method logically belongs to the class's functionality.
  
2. **Prefer Free Functions:**
    - If a function doesn't interact with class or instance data, consider placing it outside the class.
  
3. **Maintain Clear Responsibilities:**
    - Ensure that methods within the class serve a clear purpose related to the class's responsibilities.

### **Example: Factory Method with `@classmethod`**

```python
from datetime import datetime

class User:
    def __init__(self, username: str, created_at: datetime):
        self.username = username
        self.created_at = created_at

    @classmethod
    def create_with_current_time(cls, username: str) -> 'User':
        return cls(username, datetime.now())

# Usage
new_user = User.create_with_current_time("johndoe")
print(new_user.created_at)  # Output: Current date and time
```

**Explanation:**

- **`create_with_current_time`:** A class method that acts as an alternative constructor, initializing a `User` instance with the current time.
- **Usage:** Provides a convenient way to create instances with specific initializations.


## 💬 Discussion Topic

**Consider some of the most important parts of your codebase. What invariants are true about that system? How well are these invariants enforced, such that developers cannot break them?**

### **Exploring the Discussion Topic**

When developing software, especially in larger codebases, defining and enforcing **invariants** is crucial for maintaining system integrity and preventing bugs. Let's delve into how invariants can be identified and enforced within a codebase.

### **Identifying Invariants in Your Codebase**

1. **Business Rules:**
    - **Example:** Each customer must have a unique email address.
    - **Invariant:** No two customer records can have the same email.

2. **Data Integrity:**
    - **Example:** Order quantities must be positive integers.
    - **Invariant:** Quantity > 0 for all order items.

3. **System Constraints:**
    - **Example:** A user's account balance cannot exceed a certain limit.
    - **Invariant:** Account balance ≤ $10,000.

4. **Logical Relationships:**
    - **Example:** An employee's start date must be before their end date.
    - **Invariant:** start_date < end_date.

### **Enforcing Invariants**

1. **Using Constructors and Methods:**
    - Implement validation within constructors (`__init__`) and methods to ensure that any changes to the object's state adhere to the invariants.
    
    ```python
    class Customer:
        def __init__(self, email: str):
            self.email = email  # Assume uniqueness is checked elsewhere

        def update_email(self, new_email: str):
            # Implement uniqueness check here
            self.email = new_email
    ```

2. **Encapsulation:**
    - Hide internal data structures and provide controlled access through methods, preventing direct modifications that could break invariants.
    
    ```python
    class Account:
        def __init__(self, balance: float):
            self.__balance = balance

        def deposit(self, amount: float):
            if amount <= 0:
                raise ValueError("Deposit amount must be positive")
            self.__balance += amount

        def withdraw(self, amount: float):
            if amount > self.__balance:
                raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")
            self.__balance -= amount

        def get_balance(self) -> float:
            return self.__balance
    ```

3. **Unit Tests:**
    - Write tests that verify invariants are maintained under various scenarios.
    
    ```python
    import unittest

    class TestAccount(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_deposit_positive(self):
            acc = Account(100)
            acc.deposit(50)
            self.assertEqual(acc.get_balance(), 150)

        def test_deposit_negative(self):
            acc = Account(100)
            with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
                acc.deposit(-50)
    ```

4. **Type Checking and Static Analysis:**
    - Utilize type hints and tools like `mypy` to catch type-related invariant violations before runtime.
    
    ```python
    from typing import Final

    class Constants:
        MAX_BALANCE: Final[float] = 10000.0
    ```

### **Evaluating Invariant Enforcement**

1. **Automated Tests:**
    - Ensure that all invariants are covered by unit tests and that these tests are run regularly (e.g., via continuous integration).
  
2. **Code Reviews:**
    - During code reviews, verify that any changes maintain existing invariants or appropriately handle their modification.

3. **Documentation:**
    - Clearly document the invariants within your codebase, using docstrings and comments to communicate expectations to other developers.

4. **Static Analysis Tools:**
    - Leverage tools that can analyze code for potential invariant violations, such as linters or type checkers.

### **Real-World Example: User Registration System**

**Invariant:** Each user must have a unique username and a valid email address.

```python
class UserRegistration:
    existing_usernames = set()

    def __init__(self, username: str, email: str):
        if username in UserRegistration.existing_usernames:
            raise ValueError("Username already exists")
        if not self.__is_valid_email(email):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email address")
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        UserRegistration.existing_usernames.add(username)
    
    def __is_valid_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
        # Simple email validation logic
        return "@" in email and "." in email.split("@")[-1]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Class Variable:**
    ```python
    existing_usernames = set()
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Tracks all existing usernames to enforce uniqueness.

2. **Constructor with Invariant Enforcement:**
    ```python
    def __init__(self, username: str, email: str):
        if username in UserRegistration.existing_usernames:
            raise ValueError("Username already exists")
        if not self.__is_valid_email(email):
            raise ValueError("Invalid email address")
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        UserRegistration.existing_usernames.add(username)
    ```
    - **Username Uniqueness:** Checks if the username already exists.
    - **Email Validation:** Ensures the email address is valid.
    - **Updating Class Variable:** Adds the new username to the set of existing usernames.

3. **Private Email Validation Method:**
    ```python
    def __is_valid_email(self, email: str) -> bool:
        # Simple email validation logic
        return "@" in email and "." in email.split("@")[-1]
    ```
    - **Purpose:** Validates the format of the email address.
    - **Encapsulation:** Private method to prevent external access.

**Usage:**

```python
try:
    user1 = UserRegistration("johndoe", "john@example.com")
    user2 = UserRegistration("janedoe", "jane@example.com")
    user3 = UserRegistration("johndoe", "john2@example.com")  # Raises ValueError
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Username already exists
```

**Benefits:**
- **Enforces Uniqueness:** Prevents duplicate usernames.
- **Validates Data:** Ensures only valid email addresses are accepted.
- **Maintains Integrity:** Keeps the system's data consistent and reliable.


## 🎯 Conclusion 🎯

**Classes** in Python are powerful tools that allow you to encapsulate data and behaviors, enforce invariants, and maintain the integrity of your objects. While data classes offer a streamlined way to handle simple data structures, regular classes provide the flexibility and control needed to manage more complex scenarios and enforce stringent rules.

### **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Constructors Provide Control:**
    - Define how objects are initialized and enforce invariants through constructors.
  
2. **Encapsulation Protects Invariants:**
    - Use access control (public, protected, private) to restrict how data is accessed and modified.
  
3. **Methods Encapsulate Behavior:**
    - Encapsulate operations related to the data within methods to maintain invariants and enhance reusability.
  
4. **Avoid Overcomplicating with Getters/Setters:**
    - Only create getters and setters when necessary to enforce rules or add logic.
  
5. **Use Exceptions Wisely:**
    - Differentiate between using assertions for development-time checks and exceptions for runtime error handling.
  
6. **Leverage Encapsulation to Prevent Broken Invariants:**
    - Design your classes to hide internal data and provide controlled access through methods.

### **Final Thoughts:**

While data classes offer convenience and reduce boilerplate for simple data storage, regular classes provide the depth and control necessary for complex systems with strict invariants and behaviors. Understanding when and how to use each construct is essential for building robust, maintainable, and scalable Python applications.

**Happy Coding!** 🚀😊🎉
