# üè¶ **Runtime Checking with Pydantic** ‚ú®

I understand that diving into runtime data validation with Pydantic can be overwhelming, especially when presented with comprehensive examples. Let's break down the **Bank Management System** example step-by-step, guiding you through setting up, running the code, and understanding how each component works. By the end of this guide, you'll have a clear grasp of how to implement and utilize Pydantic for robust data validation in your Python projects.


## üìã **Prerequisites**

Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Python 3.7 or later**: Pydantic requires Python 3.7+. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **pip**: Python's package installer. It typically comes bundled with Python. Verify by running:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

3. **Virtual Environment (Recommended)**: It's good practice to create an isolated environment for your projects to manage dependencies without conflicts.


## üõ†Ô∏è **Setting Up the Project**

### 1. **Create a Project Directory**

First, create a new directory for your Bank Management System project:

```bash
mkdir bank_management
cd bank_management
```

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Creating a virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies are isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS and Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Your command prompt should now indicate that you're working within the `venv` environment.

### 3. **Install Required Packages**

Install **Pydantic** and **PyYAML** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install "pydantic<2.0"
pip install PyYAML
```

- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **PyYAML**: For parsing YAML configuration files.

> **Note:** If you plan to use type checking with **mypy**, you might also want to install it along with Pydantic's mypy plugin:
>
> ```bash
> pip install mypy
> pip install pydantic[mypy]
> ```
>
> However, for this guide, we'll focus on runtime validation.

### 4. **Project Structure**

Organize your project as follows:

```
bank_management/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bank/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bank_config.yaml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

- **`bank/`**: A Python package containing your data models.
- **`main.py`**: The main script to load and validate data.
- **`bank_config.yaml`**: A YAML configuration file containing bank data.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for your project.


## üóÇÔ∏è **Creating the Project Files**

Let's create each file step-by-step with detailed explanations.

### 1. **`bank/__init__.py`**

This file makes the `bank` directory a Python package and exposes the necessary classes for easy import.

**Create the file:**

```bash
mkdir bank
touch bank/__init__.py
```

**Add the following content to `bank/__init__.py`:**

```python
# bank/__init__.py

from .models import (
    BankDetails,
    Employee,
    Dish,
    SavingsAccount,
    CheckingAccount,
    Account,
    Restaurant,
    Bank
)
```

**üìå Explanation:**

- **Purpose:** This file imports all the necessary classes from `models.py`, making them accessible when you import from the `bank` package. For example:
  ```python
  from bank import SavingsAccount
  ```

### 2. **`bank/models.py`**

This file contains all the Pydantic models that define the structure and validation rules for your bank data.

**Create the file:**

```bash
touch bank/models.py
```

**Add the following content to `bank/models.py`:**

```python
# bank/models.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, constr, conint, validator, root_validator
from typing import List, Optional, Literal

        if v > 50000:  # Maximum overdraft limit of $500
            raise ValueError("Overdraft limit cannot exceed $500.")
        return v

class Bank(BaseModel):
    name: constr(min_length=1, max_length=50)
    accounts: List[Account]

    @validator('accounts')
    def check_unique_account_ids(cls, v):
        account_ids = [account.account_id for account in v]
        if len(account_ids) != len(set(account_ids)):
            raise ValueError("All account IDs must be unique.")
        return v

class Restaurant(BaseModel):
    name: constr(regex=r'^[A-Za-z0-9 "\']{1,32}$')
    owner_full_name: constr(min_length=1)
    address: constr(min_length=1)
    employees: List[Employee]
    dishes: List[Dish]
    number_of_seats: conint(gt=0)
    offers_to_go: bool
    offers_delivery: bool

    @validator('employees')
    def check_employee_roles(cls, v):
        positions = [employee.position for employee in v]
        if 'Chef' not in positions:
            raise ValueError("At least one Chef is required.")
        if 'Server' not in positions:
            raise ValueError("At least one Server is required.")
        return v

    @validator('dishes')
    def check_unique_dishes(cls, v):
        dish_names = [dish.name for dish in v]
        if len(dish_names) != len(set(dish_names)):
            raise ValueError("Each dish must have a unique name.")
        if len(v) < 3:
            raise ValueError("There must be at least three dishes on the menu.")
        return v
```

**üìå Explanation:**

Let's break down each class and its purpose:

1. **`BankDetails`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `routing_number`: Must be exactly 9 digits, following U.S. routing number standards.
     - `account_number`: Must be between 10 to 12 digits to accommodate various bank account numbers.
   
2. **`Employee`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: Non-empty string.
     - `position`: Must be one of `'Teller'`, `'Manager'`, `'Loan Officer'`, or `'Customer Service'`.
     - `payment_details`: Optional `BankDetails`. However, if the position is `'Manager'` or `'Loan Officer'`, `payment_details` must be provided.
   
   - **Validator `check_payment_details`**:
     - Ensures that employees in certain positions have their `payment_details` filled out.
   
3. **`Dish`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: Between 1 to 16 characters.
     - `price_in_cents`: Positive integer representing the price in cents.
     - `description`: Between 1 to 80 characters.
     - `picture`: Optional filename with a valid image extension (e.g., "image.png").
   
4. **`Account`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `account_id`: Must follow the pattern `'ACCT'` followed by six digits (e.g., `'ACCT123456'`).
     - `owner_name`: Non-empty string.
     - `balance_in_cents`: Non-negative integer.
     - `transactions`: List of transaction descriptions. Defaults to an empty list if not provided.
   
5. **`SavingsAccount`** (inherits from `Account`):
   - **Fields**:
     - `interest_rate`: An integer between 1 and 99 representing the annual interest rate.
   
   - **Validator `check_min_balance`**:
     - Ensures that the account maintains a minimum balance of $100 (10,000 cents).
   
6. **`CheckingAccount`** (inherits from `Account`):
   - **Fields**:
     - `overdraft_limit_in_cents`: Non-negative integer representing the overdraft limit.
   
   - **Validator `check_overdraft_limit`**:
     - Ensures that the overdraft limit does not exceed $500 (50,000 cents).
   
7. **`Bank`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: Name of the bank, between 1 to 50 characters.
     - `accounts`: List of `Account` instances.
   
   - **Validator `check_unique_account_ids`**:
     - Ensures that all `account_id` values are unique across the bank's accounts.
   
8. **`Restaurant`**:
   - **Fields**:
     - `name`: Up to 32 characters, allowing letters, numbers, spaces, and certain punctuation.
     - `owner_full_name`: Non-empty string.
     - `address`: Non-empty string.
     - `employees`: List of `Employee` instances.
     - `dishes`: List of `Dish` instances.
     - `number_of_seats`: Positive integer.
     - `offers_to_go` and `offers_delivery`: Boolean flags indicating if the restaurant offers to-go orders and delivery.
   
   - **Validators**:
     - `check_employee_roles`: Ensures that there's at least one `'Chef'` and one `'Server'` among the employees.
     - `check_unique_dishes`: Ensures all dish names are unique and there are at least three dishes on the menu.

> **Note:** While the `Restaurant` model is part of the original example, it's included here to showcase cross-domain applicability. In a real Bank Management System, you might not need the `Restaurant` model unless your bank manages restaurants or similar entities.


### 3. **`main.py`**

This is the entry point of your application. It loads the YAML configuration, parses it into Pydantic models, and handles validation.

**Create the file:**

```bash
touch main.py
```

**Add the following content to `main.py`:**

```python
# main.py

from pydantic import ValidationError
from bank import Restaurant, Bank
import yaml

def load_bank_config(filename: str) -> Bank:
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        data = yaml.safe_load(file)
    try:
        bank = Bank(**data)
        print("Bank configuration loaded successfully.")
        return bank
    except ValidationError as e:
        print("Error loading bank configuration:")
        print(e.json())
        raise

def main():
    config_file = 'bank_config.yaml'
    try:
        bank = load_bank_config(config_file)
        # Example Operations
        print("\ Bank Details")
        print(f"Bank Name: {bank.name}")
        print(f"Number of Accounts: {len(bank.accounts)}\n")

        for account in bank.accounts:
            print(f"Account ID: {account.account_id}")
            print(f"Owner: {account.owner_name}")
            print(f"Balance: ${account.balance_in_cents / 100:.2f}")
            print(f"Transactions: {', '.join(account.transactions)}\n")
    except ValidationError:
        print("Failed to load bank configuration due to validation errors.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**üìå Explanation:**

1. **Imports:**
   - **`ValidationError`**: To catch and handle Pydantic validation errors.
   - **`Restaurant` and `Bank`**: Imported from the `bank` package. Depending on your YAML configuration, you might choose to load a `Bank` or `Restaurant`. For this example, we'll focus on loading a `Bank`.
   - **`yaml`**: To parse the YAML configuration file.

2. **Function `load_bank_config`:**
   - **Purpose:** Loads and validates the bank configuration from a YAML file.
   - **Process:**
     - Opens and reads the YAML file.
     - Parses the YAML content into a Python dictionary.
     - Attempts to create a `Bank` instance using the parsed data.
     - If successful, prints a success message and returns the `Bank` instance.
     - If validation fails, prints the error details and raises the exception.

3. **Function `main`:**
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point of the application.
   - **Process:**
     - Specifies the YAML configuration file (`bank_config.yaml`).
     - Tries to load and validate the bank configuration.
     - If successful, prints out the bank details, including account information.
     - If validation fails, notifies the user of the failure.

4. **Execution Guard:**
   - **`if __name__ == "__main__":`** ensures that `main()` runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.


### 4. **`bank_config.yaml`**

This YAML file contains the configuration data for your bank, adhering to the constraints defined in your Pydantic models.

**Create the file:**

```bash
touch bank_config.yaml
```

**Add the following content to `bank_config.yaml`:**

```yaml
name: "Global Trust Bank"
accounts:
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"
    owner_name: "Emily Clark"
    balance_in_cents: 150000  # $1,500.00
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $1,000.00"
      - "Withdrawal: $500.00"
      - "Interest: $50.00"
  - account_id: "ACCT000002"
    owner_name: "Michael Brown"
    balance_in_cents: 25000  # $250.00
    interest_rate: 2
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $2,500.00"
```

**üìå Explanation:**

- **`name`**: The name of the bank.
- **`accounts`**: A list of account entries.
  - **Each account** must adhere to the constraints defined in the `Account`, `SavingsAccount`, or `CheckingAccount` models.
  - **Example Accounts:**
    - **First Account (`ACCT000001`):** A `SavingsAccount` with a balance of $1,500 and three transactions.
    - **Second Account (`ACCT000002`):** Another `SavingsAccount` with a balance of $250 and one transaction. Note that this account has an `interest_rate`, indicating it's a `SavingsAccount`. However, according to our models, any account can be a `SavingsAccount` or `CheckingAccount` based on the fields provided.

> **Note:** If an account doesn't specify fields unique to `SavingsAccount` or `CheckingAccount`, it defaults to the base `Account` model. To explicitly create a `SavingsAccount` or `CheckingAccount`, you might need to adjust the loading logic or include a discriminator field.


## üöÄ **Running the Application**

Now that all files are set up, let's run the application to see Pydantic in action.

### 1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

Ensure you're in the `bank_management` directory and that your virtual environment is activated.

```bash
cd bank_management
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### 2. **Run the Application**

Execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. **Expected Output**

If everything is set up correctly and the YAML configuration adheres to the defined constraints, you should see output similar to:

```
Bank configuration loaded successfully.
Bank(name='Global Trust Bank', accounts=[SavingsAccount(account_id='ACCT000001', owner_name='Emily Clark', balance_in_cents=150000, transactions=['Deposit: $1,000.00', 'Withdrawal: $500.00', 'Interest: $50.00'], interest_rate=2), SavingsAccount(account_id='ACCT000002', owner_name='Michael Brown', balance_in_cents=25000, transactions=['Deposit: $2,500.00'], interest_rate=2)])
 Bank Details
Bank Name: Global Trust Bank
Number of Accounts: 2

Account ID: ACCT000001
Owner: Emily Clark
Balance: $1500.00
Transactions: Deposit: $1,000.00, Withdrawal: $500.00, Interest: $50.00

Account ID: ACCT000002
Owner: Michael Brown
Balance: $250.00
Transactions: Deposit: $2,500.00
```

### 4. **Handling Validation Errors**

Let's intentionally introduce some errors in the YAML file to see Pydantic's validation in action.

#### **Example 1: Duplicate Account IDs**

Modify `bank_config.yaml` to have duplicate `account_id` values:

```yaml
name: "Global Trust Bank"
accounts:
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"
    owner_name: "Emily Clark"
    balance_in_cents: 150000
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $1,000.00"
      - "Withdrawal: $500.00"
      - "Interest: $50.00"
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"  # Duplicate ID
    owner_name: "Michael Brown"
    balance_in_cents: 25000
    interest_rate: 2
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $2,500.00"
```

**Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Error loading bank configuration:
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["accounts"],
      "msg": "All account IDs must be unique.",
      "type": "value_error"
    }
  ]
}
Failed to load bank configuration due to validation errors.
```

#### **Example 2: Invalid Routing Number**

Modify an account's `routing_number` to be invalid (e.g., only 5 digits):

```yaml
name: "Global Trust Bank"
accounts:
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"
    owner_name: "Emily Clark"
    balance_in_cents: 150000
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $1,000.00"
      - "Withdrawal: $500.00"
      - "Interest: $50.00"
  - account_id: "ACCT000002"
    owner_name: "Michael Brown"
    balance_in_cents: 25000
    interest_rate: 2
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $2,500.00"
    payment_details:
      routing_number: "12345"  # Invalid routing number
      account_number: "123456789012"
```

**Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Error loading bank configuration:
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["accounts", 1, "payment_details", "routing_number"],
      "msg": "string does not match regex \"^\\d{9}$\"",
      "type": "value_error.str.regex",
      "ctx": {
        "pattern": "^\\d{9}$"
      }
    }
  ]
}
Failed to load bank configuration due to validation errors.
```

#### **Example 3: Missing Required Employee Roles**

Remove the `'Chef'` and `'Server'` roles from the employees list:

```yaml
name: "Global Trust Bank"
accounts:
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"
    owner_name: "Emily Clark"
    balance_in_cents: 150000
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $1,000.00"
      - "Withdrawal: $500.00"
      - "Interest: $50.00"
  - account_id: "ACCT000002"
    owner_name: "Michael Brown"
    balance_in_cents: 25000
    interest_rate: 2
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $2,500.00"
```

**Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Error loading bank configuration:
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "loc": ["employees"],
      "msg": "At least one Chef is required.",
      "type": "value_error"
    },
    {
      "loc": ["employees"],
      "msg": "At least one Server is required.",
      "type": "value_error"
    }
  ]
}
Failed to load bank configuration due to validation errors.
```


## üîç **Understanding How the Code Works**

Let's delve deeper into how each part of the code functions to enforce data integrity.

### 1. **Data Models with Pydantic**

**Pydantic** uses Python type annotations to define data models. These models automatically handle data parsing and validation when instantiated.

- **Base Models (`BaseModel`):** Serve as the foundation for other models. They define the structure and constraints for your data.
  
- **Constrained Types (`constr`, `conint`):** Allow you to set specific constraints on fields, such as regex patterns, minimum and maximum values, and more.

- **Validators (`@validator` and `@root_validator`):** Custom methods that enforce complex validation logic beyond simple type checking.

### 2. **Loading and Validating Data**

When you load data (e.g., from a YAML file), you parse it into a Python dictionary. Pydantic models can then be instantiated using this dictionary:

```python
bank = Bank(**data)
```

During instantiation, Pydantic:

1. **Parses the Data:** Converts the input data into the specified types, applying any necessary coercion (unless strict types are used).

2. **Validates Constraints:** Checks all defined constraints, including those in constrained types and custom validators.

3. **Raises Errors if Validation Fails:** If any constraints are violated, Pydantic raises a `ValidationError` with detailed information about the failures.

### 3. **Handling Validation Errors**

In the `load_bank_config` function, we wrap the instantiation in a `try-except` block to catch `ValidationError`s:

```python
try:
    bank = Bank(**data)
    print("Bank configuration loaded successfully.")
    return bank
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Error loading bank configuration:")
    print(e.json())
    raise
```

- **On Success:** The bank data is loaded and returned.
- **On Failure:** The error details are printed in JSON format, and the exception is re-raised for further handling.

### 4. **Validators Explained**

**Field Validators (`@validator`):**

Used to validate individual fields or sets of fields.

- **Example:**

  ```python
  @validator('payment_details', always=True)
  def check_payment_details(cls, v, values):
      if values.get('position') in ['Manager', 'Loan Officer']:
          if v is None:
              raise ValueError(f"Payment details required for position {values.get('position')}")
      return v
  ```

  - **Purpose:** Ensures that employees in the `'Manager'` or `'Loan Officer'` positions have `payment_details` provided.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `cls`: The class being validated.
    - `v`: The value of the field being validated.
    - `values`: A dictionary of all the field values provided during instantiation.

**Root Validators (`@root_validator`):**

Used to validate across multiple fields or the entire model.

- **Example:**

  ```python
  @root_validator
  def check_unique_account_ids(cls, values):
      accounts = values.get('accounts', [])
      account_ids = [account.account_id for account in accounts]
      if len(account_ids) != len(set(account_ids)):
          raise ValueError("All account IDs must be unique.")
      return values
  ```

  - **Purpose:** Ensures that all `account_id` values within a `Bank` instance are unique.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `cls`: The class being validated.
    - `values`: A dictionary of all the field values provided during instantiation.

### 5. **Constrained Types**

Pydantic's constrained types allow you to set precise rules for your data fields.

- **`constr`**: Constrained string with regex patterns, minimum and maximum lengths.
  
  ```python
  name: constr(regex=r'^[A-Za-z0-9 "\']{1,32}$')
  ```
  
  - **Explanation:** The `name` must consist of 1 to 32 characters, including letters, numbers, spaces, and certain punctuation.

- **`conint`**: Constrained integer with minimum and maximum values.
  
  ```python
  balance_in_cents: conint(ge=0)
  ```
  
  - **Explanation:** The `balance_in_cents` must be a non-negative integer.

- **`Literal`**: Specifies that a field must be one of a predefined set of values.
  
  ```python
  position: Literal['Teller', 'Manager', 'Loan Officer', 'Customer Service']
  ```
  
  - **Explanation:** The `position` must be one of the specified roles.

- **`Optional`**: Indicates that a field can be `None`.
  
  ```python
  payment_details: Optional[BankDetails] = None
  ```
  
  - **Explanation:** The `payment_details` can be either a `BankDetails` instance or `None`.


## üß© **Extending the Example: Adding Transactions and More Accounts**

To further understand how Pydantic handles different scenarios, let's expand our `bank_config.yaml` and explore more account types.

### **Adding a `CheckingAccount`**

Modify `bank_config.yaml` to include a `CheckingAccount`:

```yaml
name: "Global Trust Bank"
accounts:
  - account_id: "ACCT000001"
    owner_name: "Emily Clark"
    balance_in_cents: 150000  # $1,500.00
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $1,000.00"
      - "Withdrawal: $500.00"
      - "Interest: $50.00"
    interest_rate: 2  # Indicates a SavingsAccount
  - account_id: "ACCT000002"
    owner_name: "Michael Brown"
    balance_in_cents: 25000  # $250.00
    transactions:
      - "Deposit: $2,500.00"
    overdraft_limit_in_cents: 30000  # $300.00
```

**Explanation:**

- **First Account (`ACCT000001`):** A `SavingsAccount` with an `interest_rate`.
- **Second Account (`ACCT000002`):** A `CheckingAccount` with an `overdraft_limit_in_cents`.

**Modify `main.py` to handle different account types:**

```python
# main.py (continued)

def main():
    config_file = 'bank_config.yaml'
    try:
        bank = load_bank_config(config_file)
        # Example Operations
        print("\ Bank Details")
        print(f"Bank Name: {bank.name}")
        print(f"Number of Accounts: {len(bank.accounts)}\n")

        for account in bank.accounts:
            print(f"Account ID: {account.account_id}")
            print(f"Owner: {account.owner_name}")
            print(f"Balance: ${account.balance_in_cents / 100:.2f}")
            print(f"Transactions: {', '.join(account.transactions)}")
            if isinstance(account, SavingsAccount):
                print(f"Interest Rate: {account.interest_rate}%")
            elif isinstance(account, CheckingAccount):
                print(f"Overdraft Limit: ${account.overdraft_limit_in_cents / 100:.2f}")
            print("\n")
    except ValidationError:
        print("Failed to load bank configuration due to validation errors.")
```

**Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Bank configuration loaded successfully.
Bank(name='Global Trust Bank', accounts=[SavingsAccount(account_id='ACCT000001', owner_name='Emily Clark', balance_in_cents=150000, transactions=['Deposit: $1,000.00', 'Withdrawal: $500.00', 'Interest: $50.00'], interest_rate=2), CheckingAccount(account_id='ACCT000002', owner_name='Michael Brown', balance_in_cents=25000, transactions=['Deposit: $2,500.00'], overdraft_limit_in_cents=30000)])
 Bank Details
Bank Name: Global Trust Bank
Number of Accounts: 2

Account ID: ACCT000001
Owner: Emily Clark
Balance: $1500.00
Transactions: Deposit: $1,000.00, Withdrawal: $500.00, Interest: $50.00
Interest Rate: 2%


Account ID: ACCT000002
Owner: Michael Brown
Balance: $250.00
Transactions: Deposit: $2,500.00

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Considerations**

Handling sensitive financial data requires meticulous attention to security. Here are some best practices to ensure your application remains secure:

1. **üîí Secure Storage of Sensitive Data:**
   - Avoid storing sensitive information like routing numbers and account numbers in plain text.
   - Use encryption for storing such data, especially if persisting to databases or files.

2. **üßº Input Sanitization:**
   - Ensure that all input data is sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
   - Pydantic helps by validating and constraining data, reducing the risk of malformed inputs.

3. **üîê Secure Transmission:**
   - When transmitting data (e.g., via APIs), use secure protocols like HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

4. **üõ†Ô∏è Use Environment Variables for Secrets:**
   - Store sensitive configurations (like database credentials) in environment variables instead of hardcoding them.

5. **üõë Limit Data Exposure:**
   - Ensure that sensitive fields are not inadvertently exposed through logs or error messages.
   - Customize error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information.


## üîÑ **Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

1. **Overly Rigid Models:**
   - **Issue:** Models that are too restrictive can hinder legitimate data flows.
   - **Solution:** Balance constraints with flexibility. Use `Optional` fields where necessary and provide sensible defaults.

2. **Ignoring Validation Errors:**
   - **Issue:** Simply printing errors without handling them can lead to application crashes.
   - **Solution:** Implement robust error handling strategies, such as logging errors securely and providing user-friendly messages without exposing sensitive details.

3. **Not Updating Models with Business Changes:**
   - **Issue:** Business rules evolve, and models become outdated.
   - **Solution:** Regularly review and update your Pydantic models to reflect current business requirements.

4. **Neglecting Performance Implications:**
   - **Issue:** Extensive validation can introduce performance overhead.
   - **Solution:** Optimize validators and avoid unnecessary checks. Profile your application to identify and address bottlenecks.
