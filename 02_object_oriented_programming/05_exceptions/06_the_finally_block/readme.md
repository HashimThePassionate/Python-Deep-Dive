#  Finally Block

#### Class and Method Definition

```python
class ExceptionsDemo:
    @staticmethod
    def show():
        reader = None
        try:
            reader = open("file.txt", "r")
            value = reader.read()
            print(value)  # This line prints the read content for demonstration purposes
            # reader.close() if any exception raise than the resource will not close thats why we use reader inside finally block
        except IOError as e:
            print("Could not read data")
        finally:
            if reader is not None:
                try:
                    reader.close()
                except IOError as e:
                    print("Could not close the file")
                    print(e)
```

1. **Class Definition:**
   - `class ExceptionsDemo:` defines a class named `ExceptionsDemo`.

2. **Static Method:**
   - `@staticmethod` decorator indicates that the `show` method does not depend on instance-specific data.
   - `def show():` defines the static method `show`.

#### Method Body

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `reader = None` initializes the `reader` variable to `None`. This is necessary to ensure it is defined before the `try` block, so it can be used in the `finally` block.

2. **Try Block:**

   ```python
   try:
       reader = open("file.txt", "r")
       value = reader.read()
       print(value)
   ```

   - `reader = open("file.txt", "r")`: Attempts to open the file `file.txt` in read mode. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened, an `IOError` will be raised.
   - `value = reader.read()`: Reads the content of the file.
   - `print(value)`: Prints the content read from the file.

3. **Except Block:**

   ```python
   except IOError as e:
       print("Could not read data")
   ```

   - If an `IOError` occurs (e.g., file not found, permission issues), this block will catch the exception.
   - `print("Could not read data")`: Prints an error message indicating that the file could not be read.

4. **Finally Block:**

   ```python
   finally:
       if reader is not None:
           try:
               reader.close()
           except IOError as e:
               print("Could not close the file")
               print(e)
   ```

   - The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not.
   - `if reader is not None:` checks if the `reader` was successfully opened.
   - `reader.close()`: Attempts to close the file. This is important to free up system resources and avoid potential data corruption.
   - If an `IOError` occurs while closing the file, the nested `try-except` block catches this and prints an error message.

#### Using the Method

```python
ExceptionsDemo.show()
```

- Calls the `show` method of the `ExceptionsDemo` class to demonstrate the file handling and exception management.

### Summary

- **`try` block:** Contains code that may raise an exception.
- **`except` block:** Handles specific exceptions that may occur in the `try` block.
- **`finally` block:** Executes code that must run no matter what happens in the `try` or `except` blocks. It is typically used for cleanup activities, such as closing files or releasing resources.

In this example, the `finally` block ensures that the file is closed properly even if an exception is raised during the file opening or reading process. This guarantees that resources are released and helps prevent resource leaks, which can lead to issues in long-running programs.
