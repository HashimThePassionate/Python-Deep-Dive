#   Comparable generic interface

### 1. **Type Safety**
By defining a generic interface that enforces comparison capabilities, you ensure that only objects of the correct type, which support comparison operations, are used. This prevents runtime errors and makes the code more robust.

### 2. **Code Reusability**
Generic interfaces allow you to write algorithms and data structures that can work with any type that implements the required interface. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication. For example, you can create a generic sorting function that can sort any list of items that implement the `Comparable` interface.

### 3. **Consistency**
When a class implements a comparable interface, it guarantees the implementation of specific methods (e.g., `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__eq__` in Python). This ensures a consistent API for comparison operations, making it easier to understand and use the class.

### 4. **Interoperability with Built-in Functions**
In languages like Java and Python, many built-in functions and libraries expect objects to implement certain comparison methods. By adhering to a comparable interface, your objects can be seamlessly integrated with these functions and libraries. For instance, Python's `sorted` function can directly sort a list of objects that implement the required comparison methods.

### 5. **Maintainability**
Implementing a comparable interface centralizes the comparison logic within the class. This makes the code easier to maintain, as any changes to the comparison logic only need to be made in one place.

### 6. **Enhanced Functionality**
With a comparable interface, you can create more advanced and flexible data structures, such as priority queues, heaps, and binary search trees, which rely on comparison operations to function correctly.


1. Import the necessary modules from `typing`.
2. Define a type variable that is bound to types that support comparison operations.
3. Create a generic class that uses this type variable.
4. Implement the comparison methods.

Here's a detailed example:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

# Define a type variable that is bound to types that support comparison operations
T = TypeVar('T', bound='Comparable')

# Define a mixin class to specify the required comparison methods
class Comparable:
    def __lt__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

    def __le__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

    def __eq__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

    def __ne__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

    def __gt__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

    def __ge__(self, other: 'Comparable') -> bool:
        return NotImplemented

# Define a generic class that uses the type variable
class ComparableObject(Generic[T], Comparable):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

    def __lt__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value < other.value

    def __le__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value <= other.value

    def __eq__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value == other.value

    def __ne__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value != other.value

    def __gt__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value > other.value

    def __ge__(self, other: 'ComparableObject[T]') -> bool:
        return self.value >= other.value

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj1 = ComparableObject(10)
    obj2 = ComparableObject(20)

    print(obj1 < obj2)  # True
    print(obj1 <= obj2) # True
    print(obj1 == obj2) # False
    print(obj1 != obj2) # True
    print(obj1 > obj2)  # False
    print(obj1 >= obj2) # False
```

In this example:

- The `Comparable` class defines the required comparison methods.
- The `ComparableObject` class is generic and extends both `Generic[T]` and `Comparable`, ensuring that it can only be instantiated with types that support comparison.
- The comparison methods are implemented in `ComparableObject`, allowing instances of this class to be compared based on their `value` attributes.
