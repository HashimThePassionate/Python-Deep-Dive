Let's go through the provided Python code line by line:

```python
import math
import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')
```
- Imports the `math` and `locale` modules.
- Sets the locale to 'en_US.UTF-8', which is used for formatting numbers and currencies in the United States.

```python
class Console:
    @staticmethod
    def read_number(prompt, min_value=None, max_value=None):
        while True:
            try:
                value = float(input(prompt))
                if min_value is not None and max_value is not None:
                    if min_value <= value <= max_value:
                        return value
                    else:
                        print(f"Enter a value between {min_value} and {max_value}")
                else:
                    return value
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
```
- Defines a class named `Console`.
- Contains a static method `read_number` to read a numeric input from the user.
- Uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user until a valid numeric value is entered.
- Handles exceptions for invalid input (non-numeric values) and prompts the user to enter a valid value.

```python
class MortgageCalculator:
    MONTHS_IN_YEAR = 12
    PERCENT = 100

    def __init__(self, principal, annual_interest, years):
        self.principal = principal
        self.annual_interest = annual_interest
        self.years = years
```
- Defines a class named `MortgageCalculator`.
- Initializes instance variables `principal`, `annual_interest`, and `years` with the provided values.

```python
    def calculate_balance(self, number_of_payments_made):
        monthly_interest = self.get_monthly_interest()
        number_of_payments = self.get_number_of_payments()

        balance = (self.principal *
                   (math.pow(1 + monthly_interest, number_of_payments) -
                    math.pow(1 + monthly_interest, number_of_payments_made)) /
                   (math.pow(1 + monthly_interest, number_of_payments) - 1))

        return balance
```
- Defines a method `calculate_balance` to compute the remaining balance of the mortgage.
- Calculates the balance based on the principal, monthly interest rate, and the number of payments made.
- Uses mathematical formulas to compute the balance.

```python
    def calculate_mortgage(self):
        monthly_interest = self.get_monthly_interest()
        number_of_payments = self.get_number_of_payments()

        mortgage = (self.principal *
                    (monthly_interest * math.pow(1 + monthly_interest, number_of_payments)) /
                    (math.pow(1 + monthly_interest, number_of_payments) - 1))

        return mortgage
```
- Defines a method `calculate_mortgage` to compute the monthly mortgage payment.
- Calculates the mortgage payment based on the principal, monthly interest rate, and the total number of payments.

```python
    def get_remaining_balances(self):
        balances = []
        number_of_payments = self.get_number_of_payments()
        for month in range(1, number_of_payments + 1):
            balances.append(self.calculate_balance(month))
        return balances
```
- Defines a method `get_remaining_balances` to compute the remaining balances for each month.
- Iterates through each month and calculates the remaining balance using the `calculate_balance` method.
- Returns a list of balances for each month.

```python
    def get_monthly_interest(self):
        return self.annual_interest / self.PERCENT / self.MONTHS_IN_YEAR

    def get_number_of_payments(self):
        return self.years * self.MONTHS_IN_YEAR
```
- Defines methods `get_monthly_interest` and `get_number_of_payments` to compute the monthly interest rate and the total number of payments respectively.

I'll continue with the explanation in the next response.

Continuing with the explanation:

```python
class MortgageReport:
    def __init__(self, calculator):
        self.calculator = calculator
        self.currency = locale.currency

    def print_payment_schedule(self):
        print("\nPAYMENT SCHEDULE")
        print("----------------")
        for balance in self.calculator.get_remaining_balances():
            print(self.currency(balance))

    def print_mortgage(self):
        mortgage = self.calculator.calculate_mortgage()
        mortgage_formatted = self.currency(mortgage, grouping=True)
        print("\nMORTGAGE")
        print("--------")
        print("Monthly Payments:", mortgage_formatted)
```
- Defines a class `MortgageReport`.
- Initializes instance variables `calculator` and `currency`.
- Contains methods `print_payment_schedule` and `print_mortgage` to print the payment schedule and mortgage details respectively.
- The `print_payment_schedule` method retrieves the remaining balances from the calculator and prints them with currency formatting.
- The `print_mortgage` method calculates and prints the monthly mortgage payment with currency formatting.

```python
def main():
    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')
    principal = int(Console.read_number("Principal: ", 1000, 1_000_000))
    annual_interest = float(Console.read_number("Annual Interest Rate: ", 1, 30))
    years = int(Console.read_number("Period (Years): ", 1, 30))

    calculator = MortgageCalculator(principal, annual_interest, years)

    report = MortgageReport(calculator)
    report.print_mortgage()
    report.print_payment_schedule()

main()
```
- Defines the `main` function as the entry point of the program.
- Sets the locale for currency formatting to 'en_US.UTF-8'.
- Prompts the user to input principal amount, annual interest rate, and period in years.
- Creates instances of `MortgageCalculator` and `MortgageReport` classes with the provided input.
- Calls methods to print mortgage details and payment schedule.

Overall, this Python script allows users to calculate mortgage-related values, such as monthly payments and remaining balances, and prints them with proper formatting.
