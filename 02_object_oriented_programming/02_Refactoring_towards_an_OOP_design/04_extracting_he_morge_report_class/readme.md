This Python code defines a `MortgageReport` class that generates and prints a payment schedule and mortgage details. It relies on the `locale` module for currency formatting.

Let's break down the code and its functionalities:

### Importing the `locale` Module

```python
import locale
```

- **`import locale`**: This statement imports the `locale` module, which provides a way to access and utilize the system's locale-specific formatting settings, such as currency symbols and number formatting.

### Class Definition: `MortgageReport`

```python
class MortgageReport:
```

- **`class MortgageReport:`**: This defines a class named `MortgageReport`, which will be responsible for generating and printing mortgage-related reports.

### Constructor Method: `__init__()`

```python
    def __init__(self, calculator):
        self.calculator = calculator
        self.currency = locale.currency
```

- **`def __init__(self, calculator):`**: This is the constructor method of the `MortgageReport` class. It initializes instances of the class.
  - **`self.calculator = calculator`**: This assigns the `calculator` object passed to the constructor to an instance variable `calculator`. This presumably is an object that calculates mortgage-related values.
  - **`self.currency = locale.currency`**: This assigns the `locale.currency` function to the instance variable `currency`. This function is later used for currency formatting.

### Method: `print_payment_schedule()`

```python
    def print_payment_schedule(self):
        print("\nPAYMENT SCHEDULE")
        print("----------------")
        for balance in self.calculator.get_remaining_balances():
            print(self.currency(balance))
```

- **`def print_payment_schedule(self):`**: This method prints the payment schedule.
  - **`print("\nPAYMENT SCHEDULE")`**: This prints a header indicating the start of the payment schedule section.
  - **`print("----------------")`**: This prints a divider line under the header.
  - **`for balance in self.calculator.get_remaining_balances():`**: This iterates over the remaining balances obtained from the `calculator` object.
    - **`print(self.currency(balance))`**: This prints each balance using the `currency` formatting function obtained from the `locale` module.

### Method: `print_mortgage()`

```python
    def print_mortgage(self):
        mortgage = self.calculator.calculate_mortgage()
        mortgage_formatted = self.currency(mortgage, grouping=True)
        print("\nMORTGAGE")
        print("--------")
        print("Monthly Payments:", mortgage_formatted)
```

- **`def print_mortgage(self):`**: This method prints mortgage details.
  - **`mortgage = self.calculator.calculate_mortgage()`**: This calculates the mortgage amount using a method called `calculate_mortgage()` from the `calculator` object.
  - **`mortgage_formatted = self.currency(mortgage, grouping=True)`**: This formats the mortgage amount using the `currency` function obtained from the `locale` module, with the `grouping=True` argument to include digit grouping.
  - **`print("\nMORTGAGE")`**: This prints a header indicating the start of the mortgage details section.
  - **`print("--------")`**: This prints a divider line under the header.
  - **`print("Monthly Payments:", mortgage_formatted)`**: This prints the formatted mortgage amount under the label "Monthly Payments".

### Summary

The `MortgageReport` class provides methods to print a payment schedule and mortgage details. It relies on a `calculator` object to perform mortgage calculations and uses the `locale` module for currency formatting. The `print_payment_schedule()` method prints the payment schedule, while the `print_mortgage()` method prints mortgage details.
