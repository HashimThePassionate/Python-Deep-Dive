## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). OOP promotes modularity, flexibility, and reusability in software development.

## Classes

Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), which are specific instances of that class. Classes encapsulate data for the object and define methods to operate on that data. They allow for abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Refactoring towards an Object-Oriented Paradigm

Refactoring towards an object-oriented paradigm involves restructuring existing code to adhere more closely to the principles of OOP. This often includes identifying and extracting classes, encapsulating data, and promoting loose coupling between objects. The goal is to improve code maintainability, readability, and extensibility.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class to inherit properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class, known as the superclass or base class. The class inheriting from the superclass is called a subclass or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical organization of classes.

## Interfaces

Interfaces define a contract for classes, specifying a set of methods that a class must implement. Unlike inheritance, which involves inheriting implementation details from a superclass, interfaces define a blueprint for methods without providing the implementation. This promotes loose coupling and enables polymorphism.
