## üß© Introduction to Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP), enabling objects of different classes to be accessed through the same interface. Derived from Greek, *poly* (many) and *morph* (form), polymorphism represents "one interface, many implementations."

In OOP, polymorphism allows functions to operate on objects of different types and execute corresponding methods at runtime. This adaptability is essential for writing flexible and scalable code.

---

## ü§î Why Polymorphism is Useful in Python

Polymorphism enhances code by making it:

- **Maintainable**: Generic functions and classes that operate across types simplify code maintenance.
- **Reusable**: Promotes the use of interfaces and abstract classes, creating reusable code components.
- **Extensible**: Enables easy expansion by adding new classes with common interfaces, enhancing code flexibility.

---

## üêç What Makes Python Polymorphic?

Python‚Äôs **dynamic typing** and **flexibility** inherently support polymorphism. Key features that make Python naturally polymorphic include:

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can refer to objects of any type at runtime.
- **Duck Typing**: Focuses on the methods an object has rather than the object‚Äôs specific class.
- **Method Overriding**: Allows subclasses to redefine methods from their superclasses.
- **Operator Overloading**: Supports customizing operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) for user-defined classes.

---

## ü¶Ü Duck Typing and Polymorphism

In Python, **duck typing** means that if an object has required methods, it‚Äôs treated as compatible, regardless of its class type. This concept aligns with the saying:

> "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it‚Äôs probably a duck."

With duck typing, an object‚Äôs type is less important than the methods it implements, making it a powerful form of polymorphism.

## üìù Polymorphism Examples in Python

Let‚Äôs explore polymorphism in action through Python examples.

## Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Animal {
        + speak(): void
    }

    class Dog {
        + speak(): void
    }

    class Cat {
        + speak(): void
    }

    Animal <|-- Dog
    Animal <|-- Cat
```


### üöÄ Method Overriding

_Method overriding_ is when a subclass redefines a method from its superclass.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("The animal makes a sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Woof!")

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Meow!")

# Demonstrate polymorphism
def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.speak()

dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!
animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!
```

**Explanation**: The `animal_sound` function works with any object having a `speak` method, showcasing polymorphism.

### ‚ûï Operator Overloading

_Operator overloading_ allows us to define custom behavior for operators with user-defined classes.

## Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Vector {
        - x: int
        - y: int
        + Vector(x: int, y: int)
        + __add__(other: Vector): Vector
        + __repr__(): str
    }
```

## Code
```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(2, 4)
v2 = Vector(5, -1)
v3 = v1 + v2

print(v3)  # Output: Vector(7, 3)
```

**Explanation**: Here, `__add__` is overloaded to add two `Vector` instances, allowing the `+` operator to work with `Vector` objects.

### üéõÔ∏è Polymorphic Functions

Functions in Python can handle various types of arguments due to polymorphism.

## Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class AddFunction {
        + add(a, b): dynamic
    }
```

## Default Polymorphism
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3))                   # Output: 8
print(add("Hello, ", "World!"))    # Output: Hello, World!
```

**Explanation**: The `add` function works with both numbers and strings due to polymorphism in the `+` operator.

### ü¶Ü Duck Typing Example

An example of duck typing, where the type of the object is less relevant than the methods it implements.

## Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Book {
        - title: str
        + Book(title: str)
        + read(): void
    }

    class Magazine {
        - title: str
        + Magazine(title: str)
        + read(): void
    }
```

## Code 
```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

    def read(self):
        print(f"You start reading '{self.title}'.")

class Magazine:
    def __init__(self, title):
        self.title = title

    def read(self):
        print(f"You flip through the magazine '{self.title}'.")

def start_reading(item):
    item.read()

book = Book("1984")
magazine = Magazine("National Geographic")

start_reading(book)       # Output: You start reading '1984'.
start_reading(magazine)   # Output: You flip through the magazine 'National Geographic'.
```

**Explanation**: The `start_reading` function works with any object having a `read` method, irrespective of its class.

## üåê Real-World Examples

Polymorphism is widely applied in real-world applications to improve flexibility and maintainability. Below, we illustrate file handling using polymorphism to work with different file types.

### Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class FileParser {
        + parse(filepath: str) <<abstract>>
    }

    class CSVParser {
        + parse(filepath: str): list
    }

    class JSONParser {
        + parse(filepath: str): dict
    }

    class XMLParser {
        + parse(filepath: str): list
    }

    FileParser <|-- CSVParser
    FileParser <|-- JSONParser
    FileParser <|-- XMLParser
```

### üìÑ File Handling with Different File Types

Imagine an app that reads data from CSV, JSON, and XML files. We can define a common interface and implement it differently for each file type.

#### Sample Data Files

**data.csv**
```csv
name,age,city,hobbies,passion,career
Muhammad Hashim,24,Islamabad,"Coffee, Mountain trips","Software Engineering","Python Instructor"
```

**data.json**
```json
[
  {"name": "Muhammad Hashim", "age": 24, "city": "Islamabad", "hobbies": ["Coffee", "Mountain trips"]}
]
```

**data.xml**
```xml
<people>
  <person>
    <name>Muhammad Hashim</name>
    <age>24</age>
    <city>Islamabad</city>
  </person>
</people>
```

#### File Parsers Implementation

```python
import csv
import json
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import os

class FileParser:
    def parse(self, filepath):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement parse method")

class CSVParser(FileParser):
    def parse(self, filepath):
        with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            return list(reader)

class JSONParser(FileParser):
    def parse(self, filepath):
        with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            return json.load(file)

class XMLParser(FileParser):
    def parse(self, filepath):
        tree = ET.parse(filepath)
        root = tree.getroot()
        return [{"name": person.find('name').text} for person in root.findall('person')]

def process_file(parser, filepath):
    try:
        if not os.path.exists(filepath):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{filepath}' does not exist.")
        
        data = parser.parse(filepath)
        print(f"Processed data from {filepath}:")
        for item in data:
            print(item)
        print('-' * 40)
        
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred while processing {filepath}: {e}")
    finally:
        print("File processing attempt completed.\n")

# Usage
parsers = [CSVParser(), JSONParser(), XMLParser()]
filepaths = ['data.csv', 'data.json', 'data.xml']

for parser, filepath in zip(parsers, filepaths):
    process_file(parser, filepath)
```

#### Explanation

- **CSVParser**: Parses CSV data into a list of dictionaries.
- **JSONParser**: Parses JSON data into a Python list.
- **XMLParser**: Parses XML data and extracts specific tags.

The `process_file` function works with any parser implementing the `parse` method, showcasing polymorphism.

## üéØ Conclusion

Polymorphism in Python fosters flexibility and reuse by enabling functions to operate on objects with different types. The real-world file-handling example highlights polymorphism‚Äôs power, showcasing how code can be adapted to new file types with minimal changes.
