## 1. Introduction to Callable Objects in Inheritance üìù

**Callable objects** provide a clean and intuitive way to represent actions or calculations in object-oriented design. This example demonstrates how **abstract base classes (ABCs)** and callable objects work together in Python. By defining abstract methods and using callable wrappers, we create a reusable and extensible way to calculate areas of shapes, achieving **separation of concerns** and **code reusability**.


## 2. Abstract Base Class (ABC) - `Shape` üîπ

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass
```

- **Purpose**: The `Shape` class is an abstract base class (ABC) defining an interface with an abstract method `area`.
- **Enforcement**: Using the `@abstractmethod` decorator ensures that every subclass of `Shape` **must implement** the `area` method.
- **Benefit**: This structure provides a consistent interface for calculating areas, ensuring that each shape subclass will have its own `area` calculation logic.


## 3. Concrete Subclasses - `Circle` and `Square` üîπ

```python
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, radius):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, side_length):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.side_length = side_length

    def area(self):
        return self.side_length ** 2
```

- **`Circle` and `Square`**: Both are concrete subclasses of `Shape`.
- **Implementation of `area`**: Each subclass provides its specific implementation of `area`:
  - `Circle` calculates area as \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \).
  - `Square` calculates area as \( \text{side\_length}^2 \).
- **Explanation**: Each shape now has a well-defined way of calculating its area, following the interface contract set by `Shape`.


## 4. Callable Object - `AreaCalculator` üîπ

```python
class AreaCalculator:
    def __init__(self, shape):
        self.shape = shape

    def __call__(self):
        return self.shape.area()
```

- **Purpose**: `AreaCalculator` is a **callable wrapper** for `Shape` objects.
- **The `__call__` Method**: By defining `__call__`, instances of `AreaCalculator` can be used like functions. When an `AreaCalculator` instance is called, it calculates and returns the area of the shape it holds.
- **Encapsulation**: This wrapper class provides a simple, function-like interface for area calculation, keeping the `area` logic encapsulated within each shape.


## 5. Usage and Execution üîπ

```python
# Create instances of Circle and Square
circle = Circle("Circle", 5)
square = Square("Square", 4)

# Create instances of AreaCalculator with Circle and Square objects
circle_calculator = AreaCalculator(circle)
square_calculator = AreaCalculator(square)

# Call the instances of AreaCalculator as if they were functions to calculate the area
circle_area = circle_calculator()
square_area = square_calculator()

# Output the results
print("Area of", circle.name, ":", circle_area)
print("Area of", square.name, ":", square_area)
```

1. **Create Shape Instances**: We create instances of `Circle` and `Square`.
2. **Wrap Shapes in Calculator**: Each shape is wrapped in an `AreaCalculator` instance, making it callable.
3. **Call Calculators**: We call `circle_calculator()` and `square_calculator()` as if they were functions. This triggers the `__call__` method to calculate and return each shape's area.


## 6. Output üéâ

```plaintext
Area of Circle : 78.5
Area of Square : 16
```

Each `AreaCalculator` instance returns the area of its associated shape. This setup allows us to easily add more shapes or customize calculations without modifying existing code, promoting code flexibility and extensibility.


## 7. Why This Approach Works Well üéØ

- **Modularity**: The `Shape` abstract base class defines a clear interface, allowing any subclass to implement its specific `area` logic.
- **Callable Objects**: `AreaCalculator` instances are callable, providing a clean, function-like interface to calculate areas.
- **Encapsulation**: The area calculation is encapsulated in the shape class, while `AreaCalculator` only facilitates the calculation without knowing the specifics.
- **Ease of Extension**: Adding new shapes with their own `area` calculations is straightforward and doesn‚Äôt require changes to `AreaCalculator`.

This pattern highlights the **power of callable objects** and **inheritance** in Python, offering a clean and flexible approach to designing object-oriented systems. üêç


## 8. Complete Code üß©

Here is the complete code with all sections combined:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract Base Class
class Shape(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

# Concrete Subclasses
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, radius):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, name, side_length):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.side_length = side_length

    def area(self):
        return self.side_length ** 2

# Callable Object
class AreaCalculator:
    def __init__(self, shape):
        self.shape = shape

    def __call__(self):
        return self.shape.area()

# Usage
circle = Circle("Circle", 5)
square = Square("Square", 4)
circle_calculator = AreaCalculator(circle)
square_calculator = AreaCalculator(square)

# Execution
circle_area = circle_calculator()
square_area = square_calculator()

# Output
print("Area of", circle.name, ":", circle_area)
print("Area of", square.name, ":", square_area)
```

This complete code combines the abstract base class, concrete subclasses, and callable object implementation, showcasing how Python‚Äôs inheritance and callable objects work together to create a flexible area calculation system.
