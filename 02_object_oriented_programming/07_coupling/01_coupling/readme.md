Certainly! Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between different modules or classes in a software system. High coupling can make the code harder to maintain, test, and refactor. By encapsulating the internal state of a class and providing controlled access through methods, we can reduce coupling and improve the flexibility and maintainability of the code. Let's break down how the given Python code reduces coupling:

### Original Code:
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self):
        self._base_salary = 0
        self._hourly_rate = 0

    def calculate_wage(self, extra_hours):
        return self._base_salary + (self._hourly_rate * extra_hours)

    def set_base_salary(self, base_salary):
        if base_salary <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Salary cannot be 0 or less.")
        self._base_salary = base_salary

    def _get_base_salary(self):
        return self._base_salary

    def _get_hourly_rate(self):
        return self._hourly_rate

    def set_hourly_rate(self, hourly_rate):
        if hourly_rate < 0:
            raise ValueError("Hourly rate cannot be negative.")
        self._hourly_rate = hourly_rate


if __name__ == "__main__":
    employee = Employee()
    employee.set_base_salary(50000)
    employee.set_hourly_rate(20)
    print(f'Get Base Salary: {employee._get_base_salary()}')
    employee._get_hourly_rate()
    print(f'Get Hourly Rate: {employee._get_hourly_rate()}')
    wage = employee.calculate_wage(10)
    print(f'Calculate wages: {wage}')
```

### How It Reduces Coupling:

1. **Encapsulation**: In the original code, the attributes `_base_salary` and `_hourly_rate` are accessed directly within the class methods. This creates tight coupling because any changes to these attributes require modifications to multiple methods. By encapsulating these attributes and providing setter and getter methods (`set_base_salary`, `set_hourly_rate`, `_get_base_salary`, `_get_hourly_rate`), the internal state of the `Employee` class is hidden. External code interacts with the class only through these methods, reducing coupling.

2. **Controlled Access**: By providing setter methods (`set_base_salary`, `set_hourly_rate`), the class controls how the attributes can be modified. This prevents invalid or inconsistent states of the `Employee` object, improving the reliability and robustness of the code.

3. **Message Passing**: External code communicates with the `Employee` class by sending messages through the setter and getter methods. This promotes loose coupling because the external code doesn't need to know about the internal implementation details of the `Employee` class; it only needs to know how to send messages and interpret the responses.

4. **Flexibility**: Encapsulating the internal state of the `Employee` class allows for easier modification and extension of the class. If the internal representation of salary or hourly rate needs to change in the future, only the setter and getter methods need to be updated, keeping the impact localized and reducing the risk of introducing bugs elsewhere in the code.

Overall, by hiding the internal state of the `Employee` class and providing controlled access through setter and getter methods, the code reduces coupling and promotes better code organization, maintainability, and flexibility.
