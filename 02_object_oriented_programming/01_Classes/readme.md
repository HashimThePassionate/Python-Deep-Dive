### 🆚 1. Class vs. Object

- **Class**: Think of a class as a **blueprint** or **template**. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that its objects (instances) will possess. A class provides the structure but not the actual values.
- **Object**: An object is a **concrete instance** of a class. It is created from the class blueprint, and each object has its own unique set of data. Objects are like real-world examples of the class.

---

### 🔍 2. What is Instantiating?

- **Instantiating** means creating an instance (object) from a class. By instantiating a class, we allocate memory and assign a specific set of data and methods to the new object. It’s the first step in bringing a class blueprint to life.

---

### 📚 3. Stack vs. Heap Memory

- **Stack Memory**: This is a space for storing local variables and function call data. It follows a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order, making it efficient for managing short-term variables. Variables here are erased once a function completes.
- **Heap Memory**: This is a larger, more flexible memory area for storing dynamic data (e.g., objects). Heap memory is managed to accommodate complex data that lasts longer than individual function calls.
- **In Python**: Memory is automatically managed through **garbage collection**. Objects are created in the heap, and the stack manages references, making memory management smoother.

---

### ⚠️ 4. Procedural Code Problems & How OOP Solves Them

- **Procedural Code Problems**: Procedural programming organizes code linearly and focuses on functions. As projects grow, procedural code can become **messy**, **hard to manage**, and **redundant**. Data and functions are often separate, making it difficult to coordinate complex systems.
- **OOP Solutions**: OOP introduces principles like **encapsulation** (bundling data and methods), **modularity** (dividing code into objects), **inheritance** (reusing code), and **polymorphism** (using objects interchangeably). Together, these make code **easier to maintain**, **scalable**, and **reusable**.

---

### 🔒 5. What is Encapsulation?

- **Encapsulation** means **bundling data** (attributes) and **functions** (methods) into a single unit or class. It’s like putting all relevant details into one secure box, allowing us to restrict external access and control interactions with an object’s state. This way, only the methods intended to interact with the data can modify it, providing security and structure.

---

### 🔐 6. Why Declare Fields as Private?

- Declaring fields as **private** means they’re only accessible within the class. This **protects the internal state** of an object, preventing outside interference. It ensures data integrity and allows the class to **control how data is accessed or modified**. Fields are usually private so that sensitive data is shielded and only modifiable through class-specific methods.

---

### 🧩 7. What is Abstraction?

- **Abstraction** is the concept of **hiding unnecessary details** and showing only essential information. It’s like using a car—you know how to drive, but you don’t need to understand the mechanics underneath. Abstraction simplifies complex systems, allowing users to interact with objects through high-level interfaces without needing to know how they work internally.

---

### 🔗 8. What is Coupling?

- **Coupling** measures **dependency** between different parts of a program. 
  - **Tightly coupled** code has interdependent parts, making modifications risky since changes in one part may impact others.
  - **Loosely coupled** code, however, is **more independent** and flexible. Each component can be changed with minimal effects on others, leading to more manageable and adaptable codebases.

---

### 🎛️ 9. How Abstraction Reduces Coupling

- **Abstraction** helps reduce coupling by only **exposing necessary features** and hiding unnecessary details. This minimizes dependencies since each component interacts only with relevant parts, creating a cleaner, more modular structure. As a result, it’s easier to modify individual parts without widespread impact.

---

### 🏗️ 10. What are Constructors?

- A **constructor** is a special method called automatically when an object is created. It **initializes the object’s attributes** and sets its initial state. Constructors ensure that an object is ready to use immediately after it’s instantiated, setting values based on the class’s design.

---

### 🧰 11. What are Static Methods?

- **Static methods** are functions within a class that are **not bound to any instance**. They don’t modify object states or access instance-specific data. Instead, static methods serve as utility functions related to the class and can be called directly from the class without needing an object instance. They’re helpful for tasks relevant to the class but not dependent on object states.

---

### ➕ 12. What is Operator Overloading?

- **Operator overloading** allows a class to **customize standard operators** (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`) so they work intuitively with objects of that class. For example, you can define what the `+` operator does when applied to instances of a custom class, making the code more intuitive and enabling operators to perform specific actions suited to that class.
