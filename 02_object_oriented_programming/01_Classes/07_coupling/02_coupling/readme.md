### How Mangling Convention Reduces Coupling:

The mangling convention in Python, denoted by prefixing attribute or method names with double underscores (`__`), is primarily used to create class-private members. These members are not accessible from outside the class, except through name mangling. While it's not a direct tool for reducing coupling, it can contribute to it indirectly. Let's examine how it affects the `Browser` class provided:

### Original Code:
```python
class Browser:
    def navigate(self, address):
        ip = self.__find_ip_address(address)
        html = self.__send_http_request(ip)
        print(html)

    def __send_http_request(self, ip):
        if ip is not None:
            return "<html></html>"
        else:
            return "No IP address or domain found"

    def __find_ip_address(self, address):
        if address:
            return address
        else:
            # return '127.0.0.1'
            return None

browser = Browser()
browser.navigate('127.0.0.0')
browser.navigate(None)
```

### How It Reduces Coupling:

1. **Encapsulation**: By using the mangling convention (`__method_name`), the `__send_http_request` and `__find_ip_address` methods are effectively made private to the `Browser` class. They cannot be accessed directly from outside the class. This encapsulation hides the internal implementation details from external code, reducing the coupling between the `Browser` class and its clients.

2. **Preventing External Access**: The methods prefixed with double underscores are name-mangled, which means their names are modified to include the class name. This prevents accidental overriding or direct access from subclasses or external code, further isolating the internal workings of the `Browser` class and reducing coupling.

3. **Promoting Information Hiding**: By making these methods private, the `Browser` class enforces information hiding, a key principle of object-oriented design. This ensures that only the necessary interfaces are exposed to external code, reducing the likelihood of unintended dependencies and potential coupling issues.

4. **Flexibility in Maintenance**: Since the internal implementation details are hidden behind the mangling convention, the `Browser` class can be modified or refactored without affecting the external code that uses it. This improves the maintainability of the codebase by reducing the ripple effects of changes, thus indirectly reducing coupling.

In summary, while mangling convention in Python isn't a direct tool for reducing coupling, its usage in creating private members helps in encapsulation, preventing external access, promoting information hiding, and improving flexibility in maintenance, all of which contribute to reducing coupling between classes.
