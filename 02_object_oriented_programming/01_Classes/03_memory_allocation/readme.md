### 📦 Overview of Memory Allocation in Python

Python uses two main areas for memory allocation:

1. **Stack Memory**: Used primarily for storing function calls and local variables.
2. **Heap Memory**: Used for dynamic memory allocation, such as objects and instances of classes.

Understanding these areas and how Python handles them helps ensure efficient resource management and optimized performance.

### 📚 Stack Memory

**Stack memory** is where Python stores:
- **Function Calls**: Each function call creates a new **stack frame**.
- **Local Variables**: Variables defined within functions are stored in their respective stack frames.

#### 🌟 Key Characteristics of Stack Memory:
- **LIFO Order**: Stack memory follows a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** structure, meaning the last function call is the first to complete.
- **Automatic Deallocation**: When a function completes, the memory allocated to its stack frame is freed automatically.
- **Limited Size**: Stack memory is limited and best suited for temporary or short-lived variables.

### 🗃️ Heap Memory

**Heap memory** in Python is used for:
- **Objects and Instances**: All objects, such as lists, dictionaries, and class instances, are stored in the heap.
- **Global Variables**: Variables accessible across multiple functions are stored in the heap.

#### 🌟 Key Characteristics of Heap Memory:
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory can be allocated and deallocated as needed, making it ideal for larger and more complex data.
- **Managed by Python’s Memory Manager**: Python’s memory manager and garbage collector manage heap memory.
- **Accessible by Reference**: Variables in the stack hold references pointing to objects in the heap, allowing multiple variables to reference the same object.

### 🧹 Python’s Garbage Collection

Python uses a **garbage collector** to manage and free up unused memory in the heap. The garbage collector employs two main techniques:

1. **Reference Counting**: Each object has a count of references pointing to it. When the count drops to zero, the object is automatically removed.
2. **Cyclic Garbage Collection**: Identifies groups of objects that reference each other in cycles (circular references) but are no longer accessible, allowing Python to reclaim their memory.

### 📝 Example to Illustrate Stack and Heap Allocation

Here’s a practical example to illustrate stack and heap allocation in Python:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

def create_student():
    # Heap Memory: The `Student` instance is created and stored here
    student = Student("Alice")

    print(student.name)
    # Stack Memory: The `student` variable is stored here

create_student()
```

- **Stack Memory**:
  - When `create_student()` is called, a **stack frame** is created for this function.
  - The local variable `student` (holding a reference to the `Student` object) resides in the stack.
- **Heap Memory**:
  - The `Student("Alice")` instance is stored in the heap, while the stack holds a reference to it.
  - When `create_student()` completes, the **stack frame** is removed, but the `Student` object remains in the heap until the garbage collector removes it.

---

### 📜 Summary

- **Stack Memory**: Used for function calls and local variables, operates in a LIFO order, and deallocates automatically.
- **Heap Memory**: Used for complex data structures (objects, classes), managed by Python’s garbage collector.
- **Garbage Collection**: Python’s garbage collector uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to manage memory in the heap.
