# Python-Deep-Dive:

Welcome to **Python Deep Dive**, a comprehensive repository designed to take you on a journey through the entire spectrum of Python programming. This repository is structured to guide you from the fundamentals, through object-oriented programming (OOP), into data structures and algorithms, and finally to the 23 classic design patterns.

## Table of Contents
1. [Fundamentals](#fundamentals)
2. [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](#object-oriented-programming-oop)
3. [Data Structures](#data-structures)
4. [Algorithms](#algorithms)
5. [Design Patterns](#design-patterns)
6. [Contributing](#contributing)

## Fundamentals
In this section, you'll learn the basics of Python, including:
- Syntax and structure
- Data types and variables
- Control flow (loops and conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Error handling and exceptions

Start here if you're new to Python or need a refresher on the basics.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
This section dives into OOP concepts in Python. You'll explore:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Special (dunder) methods
- Class-level and instance-level attributes

Learn how to design robust object-oriented applications in Python.

## Data Structures
Here, you'll discover the built-in and custom data structures used in Python, including:
- Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- Stacks and queues
- Linked lists
- Trees and graphs
- Heaps and hash tables

Understanding these structures is crucial for building efficient and scalable applications.

## Algorithms
In this section, you'll find various algorithms implemented in Python, covering:
- Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, etc.)
- Searching algorithms (binary search, linear search, etc.)
- Recursion and iterative solutions
- Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms

These algorithms form the backbone of many computer science problems and interview questions.

## Design Patterns
Finally, explore the 23 classic design patterns from the "Gang of Four," with Python implementations, including:
- Creational patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype, Abstract Factory)
- Structural patterns (Adapter, Composite, Bridge, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)
- Behavioral patterns (Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor)

Learn how these patterns can be applied to solve common software design challenges.
