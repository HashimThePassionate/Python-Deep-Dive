## Introduction üèóÔ∏è

The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that helps in constructing complex objects step by step. Unlike other patterns like the Factory Method or Abstract Factory, the Builder Pattern is used when:

- Objects need to be created in multiple steps.
- The creation process involves assembling multiple parts.
- The object is not considered complete until all parts are constructed.

**Key Concept:** The Builder Pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.

---

## Real-World Examples üåç

### 1. Fast-Food Restaurants üçî

- A **burger** is always prepared using the same steps (making the patty, adding toppings, packaging).
- The **differences** between a classic burger and a cheeseburger lie in their representation (type of cheese, sauce, etc.), not the construction steps.

**Actors in this Example:**

- **Director:** The cashier, who gives instructions on what needs to be prepared.
- **Builder:** The cook, who follows the instructions to prepare the order.

### 2. Django Query Builder üñ•Ô∏è

- The `django-query-builder` library allows dynamic SQL query creation by following the Builder Pattern.
- Developers can dynamically build queries ranging from simple to complex using this library.

---

## Comparison with the Factory Pattern üè≠

The Builder Pattern differs from the Factory Pattern in the following ways:

| Feature                  | Factory Pattern      | Builder Pattern                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Construction Process** | Single step          | Multiple steps                   |
| **Control Over Process** | Minimal              | Full control over each step      |
| **Director Role**        | Not required         | Often involves a director        |
| **Return Object**        | Returned immediately | Returned explicitly upon request |

---

## Use Cases for the Builder Pattern ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Complex Object Creation:**

   - Useful when creating objects involves multiple steps or configurations.

2. **Avoiding Confusion:**

   - Prevents confusion caused by having multiple constructors with different parameters.

3. **Encapsulating Complexity:**

   - Handles scenarios where object construction involves validations, setting up data structures, or external calls.

## Implementing the Builder Pattern üõ†Ô∏è

Let's create a **Pizza Ordering Application** to demonstrate the Builder Pattern. üçï

### Step 1: Imports and Constants

We start with the necessary imports and constants:
**[Complete Code Explanations](./code.md)**
```python
import time
from enum import Enum

PizzaProgress = Enum("PizzaProgress", "queued preparation baking ready")
PizzaDough = Enum("PizzaDough", "thin thick")
PizzaSauce = Enum("PizzaSauce", "tomato creme_fraiche")
PizzaTopping = Enum(
    "PizzaTopping",
    "mozzarella double_mozzarella bacon ham mushrooms red_onion oregano",
)
STEP_DELAY = 3  # Delay between steps in seconds
```

**Explanation:**

- Enums like `PizzaProgress`, `PizzaDough`, and `PizzaSauce` represent different attributes of a pizza.
- `STEP_DELAY` introduces a pause between each preparation step to mimic a real-world delay.

---

### Step 2: The Pizza Class

The `Pizza` class represents the end product. It is minimal and relies on the builder for its construction.

```python
class Pizza:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.dough = None
        self.sauce = None
        self.topping = []

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

    def prepare_dough(self, dough):
        self.dough = dough
        print(f"Preparing the {self.dough.name} dough of your {self}...")
        time.sleep(STEP_DELAY)
        print(f"Done with the {self.dough.name} dough")
```

**Explanation:**

- The `Pizza` class initializes attributes like `name`, `dough`, `sauce`, and `topping`.
- The `prepare_dough` method simulates dough preparation with a delay.

---

### Step 3: The Builders

Builders handle the step-by-step construction of the pizza.

#### MargaritaBuilder

```python
class MargaritaBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pizza = Pizza("margarita")
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.queued
        self.baking_time = 5

    def prepare_dough(self):
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.preparation
        self.pizza.prepare_dough(PizzaDough.thin)

    def add_sauce(self):
        print(f"Adding the tomato sauce to your {self.pizza}...")
        time.sleep(STEP_DELAY)
        print("Done with the tomato sauce")

    def add_topping(self):
        print(f"Adding the topping (double mozzarella, oregano) to your {self.pizza}...")
        time.sleep(STEP_DELAY)
        print("Done with the topping")

    def bake(self):
        print(f"Baking your {self.pizza} for {self.baking_time} seconds...")
        time.sleep(self.baking_time)
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.ready
        print(f"Your {self.pizza} is ready!")
```

#### CreamyBaconBuilder

```python
class CreamyBaconBuilder:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pizza = Pizza("creamy bacon")
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.queued
        self.baking_time = 7

    def prepare_dough(self):
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.preparation
        self.pizza.prepare_dough(PizzaDough.thick)

    def add_sauce(self):
        print(f"Adding the cr√®me fra√Æche sauce to your {self.pizza}...")
        time.sleep(STEP_DELAY)
        print("Done with the cr√®me fra√Æche sauce")

    def add_topping(self):
        print(f"Adding the topping (mozzarella, bacon, ham, mushrooms, red onion, oregano) to your {self.pizza}...")
        time.sleep(STEP_DELAY)
        print("Done with the topping")

    def bake(self):
        print(f"Baking your {self.pizza} for {self.baking_time} seconds...")
        time.sleep(self.baking_time)
        self.progress = PizzaProgress.ready
        print(f"Your {self.pizza} is ready!")
```

**Explanation:**

- Each builder initializes a specific pizza and handles its unique attributes.
- Additional methods like `add_sauce()`, `add_topping()`, and `bake()` handle specific steps in the pizza-making process.

---

### Step 4: The Waiter (Director)

The `Waiter` directs the pizza-building process.

```python
class Waiter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.builder = None

    def construct_pizza(self, builder):
        self.builder = builder
        steps = (
            builder.prepare_dough,
            builder.add_sauce,
            builder.add_topping,
            builder.bake,
        )
        [step() for step in steps]

    @property
    def pizza(self):
        return self.builder.pizza
```

---

### Step 5: Validation

The `validate_style` function ensures valid user input:

```python
def validate_style(builders):
    try:
        pizza_style = input("What pizza would you like, [m]argarita or [c]reamy bacon? ")
        builder = builders[pizza_style]()
        return (True, builder)
    except KeyError:
        print("Sorry, only margarita (key m) and creamy bacon (key c) are available")
        return (False, None)
```

---

### Step 6: Main Function

The main function orchestrates the program:

```python
def main():
    builders = dict(m=MargaritaBuilder, c=CreamyBaconBuilder)
    valid_input = False

    while not valid_input:
        valid_input, builder = validate_style(builders)

    waiter = Waiter()
    waiter.construct_pizza(builder)
    pizza = waiter.pizza
    print(f"Enjoy your {pizza}!")
```

---

## Output of the Program üì§

Example output when running the program:

```
What pizza would you like, [m]argarita or [c]reamy bacon? c
Preparing the thick dough of your creamy bacon...
Done with the thick dough
Adding the cr√®me fra√Æche sauce to your creamy bacon
Done with the cr√®me fra√Æche sauce
Adding the topping (mozzarella, bacon, ham, mushrooms, red onion, oregano) to your creamy bacon
Done with the topping
Baking your creamy bacon for 7 seconds
Your creamy bacon is ready
Enjoy your creamy bacon!
```

## Extending the Pattern üîÑ

Want more pizza types? You can add a new builder (e.g., **HawaiianPizzaBuilder**) by inheriting from the existing builders or using composition for flexibility. üççüçï
