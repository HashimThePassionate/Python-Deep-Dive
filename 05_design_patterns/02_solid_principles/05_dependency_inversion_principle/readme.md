## 🔍 Introduction

The **Dependency Inversion Principle (main)** is a key concept in software design and one of the SOLID principles. 🛡️ It emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend directly on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions or interfaces. By following main, you decouple the high-level components from the details of the low-level components, making your software more flexible and easier to maintain. 📈

### 📌 Why main Matters

- **Reduces Coupling**: Minimizes dependencies between different parts of your system.
- **Enhances Flexibility**: Makes it easier to swap out implementations without affecting other parts.
- **Improves Testability**: Facilitates testing by allowing the use of mock implementations.
- **Promotes Reusability**: Encourages the creation of reusable and interchangeable components.

---

## 💡 What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (main)?

**Dependency Inversion Principle (main)** states that:

1. **High-Level Modules Should Not Depend on Low-Level Modules**: Both should depend on abstractions.
2. **Abstractions Should Not Depend on Details**: Details should depend on abstractions.

In simpler terms, main encourages designing your system so that high-level components (like business logic) do not rely on low-level components (like utility classes). Instead, both rely on abstract interfaces, promoting a more modular and maintainable architecture. 🔄

### 📌 Key Points of main:

- **Abstractions Over Implementations**: Depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.
- **Invert Dependencies**: High-level modules define the abstractions, and low-level modules implement them.
- **Decoupling**: Reduces direct dependencies, making the system easier to manage and extend.

### 🧠 Understanding Through Analogy

Imagine you have a remote control (high-level module) that operates your TV (low-level module). If the remote directly depends on the TV's specific implementation, changing the TV model would require changing the remote. Instead, if both the remote and TV depend on a universal interface (like infrared signals), you can easily swap out the TV without modifying the remote. Similarly, main promotes such flexible and decoupled interactions in software design. 📺🔄

## 🏆 Benefits of main

Implementing main brings several significant advantages to your software projects:

- **🔧 Maintainability**: Keeps high-level policies separate from low-level details, making the code easier to maintain and update.
- **🛠️ Extensibility**: Facilitates adding new functionalities or changing existing ones without modifying high-level modules.
- **🧪 Testability**: Simplifies testing by allowing the use of mock implementations for interfaces.
- **📚 Readability**: Clear separation of concerns improves code readability and comprehension.
- **🚀 Scalability**: Supports scalable architectures where components can grow independently.

### 📈 Real-World Impact

- **Easier Refactoring**: Changes in low-level modules do not ripple through high-level modules.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Teams can work on different layers (high-level and low-level) independently by adhering to defined interfaces.
- **Better Code Reusability**: Abstract interfaces can be reused across different parts of the system or even different projects.

## 🛠️ How to Apply main

Following main involves designing your classes and modules to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. 🧩 Here are detailed steps to apply main effectively:

1. **🔍 Identify Dependencies**:
   - Determine which high-level modules depend on which low-level modules.
   - Identify areas where direct dependencies can be inverted.

2. **📐 Define Abstractions**:
   - Create interfaces or abstract classes that represent the desired functionalities.
   - Ensure that these abstractions capture the essential behaviors required by high-level modules.

3. **✅ Implement Interfaces**:
   - Have low-level modules implement the defined interfaces.
   - Ensure that implementations adhere strictly to the contracts defined by the interfaces.

4. **🔄 Invert Dependencies**:
   - Refactor high-level modules to depend on the abstractions instead of concrete implementations.
   - Use dependency injection to pass implementations to high-level modules.

5. **🧩 Promote Polymorphism**:
   - Leverage polymorphism to allow high-level modules to interact with different implementations through the same interface.
   - This enhances flexibility and makes it easier to introduce new implementations.

6. **🔄 Refactor Existing Code**:
   - Analyze existing code to identify direct dependencies between high-level and low-level modules.
   - Introduce abstractions and refactor code to adhere to main.

### 📌 Best Practices

- **Single Responsibility**: Align with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by ensuring interfaces have one purpose.
- **Interface Segregation**: Follow the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) to create focused interfaces.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for interfaces and implementations.
- **Avoid Tight Coupling**: Ensure that high-level modules are not tightly coupled to specific low-level implementations.

## 📂 Example: Notification and Email Before main

Let's examine an example where the Dependency Inversion Principle is violated. Imagine you have a `Notification` class responsible for sending notifications via email, using an `Email` class. 📧📬

```python
class Email:
    def send_email(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class Notification:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.email = Email()

    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.email.send_email(message)
```

### 📝 Explanation:

- **`Email` Class**:
  - Implements the `send_email` method to send emails.
  
- **`Notification` Class**:
  - Depends directly on the `Email` class.
  - Creates an instance of `Email` within its constructor.
  - Calls the `send_email` method to send notifications.
  
### ⚠️ Issue:

In this design:

- **High-Level Module (`Notification`) Depends on Low-Level Module (`Email`)**:
  - This creates a tight coupling between `Notification` and `Email`.
  
- **Lack of Abstraction**:
  - If you want to change the notification method (e.g., send via SMS), you would need to modify the `Notification` class directly.
  
- **Reduced Flexibility**:
  - Hard to introduce new notification methods without altering existing high-level code.
  
### 📌 Consequences:

- **Difficult Maintenance**: Changing low-level modules requires changes in high-level modules.
- **Increased Risk of Bugs**: Modifying shared code can introduce unexpected issues.
- **Limited Reusability**: `Email` class cannot be easily reused in different contexts without tight coupling.

## 🔄 Refactoring to Follow main

To adhere to main, we'll refactor the code by introducing an abstraction that both high-level and low-level modules depend on. 🛠️✨ This involves creating a `MessageSender` interface that defines the contract for sending messages. High-level modules will depend on this interface instead of concrete implementations.

### 1. Defining the `MessageSender` Interface

First, we'll define a `MessageSender` interface using Python's `Protocol` from the `typing` module. This interface will declare the `send` method that all message senders must implement. 📐

```python
from typing import Protocol

class MessageSender(Protocol):
    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        ...
```

### 📌 Explanation:

- **`MessageSender` Protocol**:
  - Defines a single method `send` that takes a `message` string.
  - Acts as an abstraction that high-level modules will depend on.
  
- **Why Use Protocols?**:
  - **Flexibility**: Allows any class that implements the `send` method to be used as a `MessageSender`.
  - **Type Safety**: Enhances static type checking, ensuring that classes adhere to the defined interface.
  - **Decoupling**: Reduces dependencies on specific implementations, promoting loose coupling.

### 2. Creating the `Email` Class

Next, we'll update the `Email` class to implement the `MessageSender` interface by defining the `send` method. 📨

```python
class Email:
    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")
```

### 📌 Explanation:

- **`Email` Class**:
  - Implements the `send` method as defined in the `MessageSender` protocol.
  - Adheres to the contract, ensuring compatibility with high-level modules.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Interchangeability**: `Email` can be used wherever a `MessageSender` is expected.
  - **Extensibility**: New message senders (e.g., `SMS`, `PushNotification`) can be added without modifying existing high-level code.

### 3. Creating the `Notification` Class

We'll update the `Notification` class to depend on the `MessageSender` abstraction instead of the concrete `Email` class. This is achieved by injecting the dependency via the constructor. 🛠️

```python
class Notification:
    def __init__(self, sender: MessageSender) -> None:
        self.sender: MessageSender = sender

    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.sender.send(message)
```

### 📌 Explanation:

- **`Notification` Class**:
  - **Constructor Injection**: Accepts a `MessageSender` instance through its constructor.
  - **Dependency on Abstraction**: Depends on the `MessageSender` interface, not on any concrete implementation.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Loose Coupling**: High-level module (`Notification`) is decoupled from low-level module (`Email`).
  - **Flexibility**: Can easily switch out different message senders without changing the `Notification` class.
  - **Enhanced Testability**: Allows for injecting mock senders during testing.

### 4. Implementing the `send` Function

We'll add a function that utilizes the `Notification` class to send messages. This function demonstrates how high-level modules interact with abstractions. 📬

```python
def send_notification(sender: MessageSender, message: str) -> None:
    notif = Notification(sender=sender)
    notif.send(message=message)
```

### 📌 Explanation:

- **`send_notification` Function**:
  - Accepts a `MessageSender` and a `message` string.
  - Creates an instance of `Notification` with the provided `sender`.
  - Calls the `send` method to dispatch the message.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Reusability**: Can work with any implementation of `MessageSender`.
  - **Decoupling**: Remains agnostic of the specific sender implementation.

### 5. Testing the Refactored Classes

Finally, we'll add a test script to verify that our refactored classes work correctly and adhere to main. 🧪

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    email_sender = Email()
    send_notification(sender=email_sender, message="This is the message.")
```

### 📌 Explanation:

- **Test Script**:
  - Creates an instance of `Email`.
  - Calls `send_notification` with the `Email` sender and a test message.
  
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  Sending email: This is the message.
  ```
  
- **Verification**:
  - Ensures that the `Notification` class successfully sends messages via the `Email` sender.
  - Demonstrates adherence to main by using abstractions instead of concrete implementations.

## 🧪 Testing the Example

To ensure that our refactored code adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle, follow these detailed steps:

### 1. Save the Code

Ensure that all the code is saved in a file named `05_dependency_inversion_principle/main.py`.

```python
from typing import Protocol

class MessageSender(Protocol):
    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        ...

class Email:
    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        print(f"Sending email: {message}")

class Notification:
    def __init__(self, sender: MessageSender) -> None:
        self.sender: MessageSender = sender

    def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        self.sender.send(message)

def send_notification(sender: MessageSender, message: str) -> None:
    notif = Notification(sender=sender)
    notif.send(message=message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    email_sender = Email()
    send_notification(sender=email_sender, message="This is the message.")
```

### 2. Run the Code

Open your terminal and execute the following command to run the script:

```bash
python 05_dependency_inversion_principle/main.py
```

### 3. Expected Output

You should see the following output in your terminal:

```
Sending email: This is the message.
```

### 4. Verify Behavior

- **`Email` Sender**:
  - The message "Sending email: This is the message." confirms that the `Email` class successfully sends the notification.
  
- **Adherence to main**:
  - The `Notification` class depends on the `MessageSender` interface, not on the `Email` class directly.
  - This allows for easy substitution of different message senders without modifying the `Notification` class.
  
- **Flexibility Demonstrated**:
  - You can introduce new message senders (e.g., `SMS`, `PushNotification`) without altering the `Notification` class or the `send_notification` function.

### 📌 Confirmation:

This output confirms that our refactored classes adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle. The high-level `Notification` class depends on the `MessageSender` abstraction, allowing for flexible and maintainable code. ✅
