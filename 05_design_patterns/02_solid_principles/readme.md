# SOLID Design Principles üöÄ

In the world of software engineering, principles and best practices are essential for building a **robust**, **maintainable**, and **efficient** codebase. Among these, the **SOLID principles**, introduced by Robert C. Martin, are key to creating software that is **understandable**, **flexible**, and **maintainable**.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Ensures that a class or module has **one and only one reason to change**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- Encourages designing software entities to be **open for extension but closed for modification**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Guarantees that derived classes can be **substituted** for their base classes without altering the behavior of the program.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Promotes the creation of **specific** interfaces rather than forcing classes to implement unnecessary methods.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Advocates for the use of **abstractions** over concrete implementations to **reduce dependency** on low-level modules.
