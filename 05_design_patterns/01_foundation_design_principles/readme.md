# 🌀 **Core Design Principles for Software Development** 🌀

Welcome! In this section, we will learn **key ideas** that make software easier to build, change, and maintain. 🛠️ These principles will help you create **better applications** that are flexible, reliable, and easy to improve. 🚀

## 🗂️ **What Will We Learn?**

### 1️⃣ **Encapsulate What Changes**  
💡 Find out how to keep the parts of your code that might change **separate**. This makes it easier to update or add new features without breaking other parts of the app.  
✨ **Result**: Your code will be more organized and easier to update.

### 2️⃣ **Prefer Composition Over Inheritance**  
🔧 Learn why it’s better to **combine simple objects** to build complex ones, rather than using inheritance (directly copying behavior). This makes your code more **flexible** and easier to reuse.  
✨ **Result**: You’ll create cleaner and simpler systems.

### 3️⃣ **Program to Interfaces, Not Concrete Classes**  
🎭 Discover why coding to **general types** (like blueprints) instead of specific ones is better. This reduces **direct dependencies** and makes your code more flexible.  
✨ **Result**: Your code can handle changes and new features smoothly.

### 4️⃣ **Keep Things Loosely Connected**  
🧩 Understand how to reduce **strong links** between parts of your code. This makes it easier to **test, change, and reuse** different parts without breaking everything else.  
✨ **Result**: Your apps will be easier to manage and grow.

## 🎯 **What You’ll Gain**  
By the end of this section, you’ll know how to:  
✅ Write **organized and flexible code**  
✅ Handle changes without stress  
✅ Build apps that are **easy to test** and **improve**
