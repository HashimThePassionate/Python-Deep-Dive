## Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on advanced text and Unicode handling in Python, covering key topics from characters and code points to proper sorting and dual-mode APIs.

## Characters, Code Points, and Byte Representations
- Understanding the relationship between characters, code points, and their byte representations.
- Examples and best practices.

## Unique Features of Binary Sequences
- Detailed exploration of `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `memoryview`.
- Use cases and examples demonstrating the unique features of these binary sequences.

## Encodings for Full Unicode and Legacy Character Sets
- Overview of different encodings and their uses.
- How to handle full Unicode and various legacy character sets in Python.

## Avoiding and Dealing with Encoding Errors
