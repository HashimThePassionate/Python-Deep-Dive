## Explanation of Mutable Default Values in `@dataclass`

### Understanding Mutable Default Values
A mutable default value is a default value that can be changed or modified. In Python, common mutable types include lists, dictionaries, and sets. Using these as default values in function or method definitions can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the same default value is shared across multiple instances or calls.

### Why Mutable Default Values Can Be Problematic
When a mutable default value is used, changes made to this default value in one instance or call can affect all subsequent instances or calls that use the same default value. This can introduce bugs that are difficult to trace and debug.

### Example of Problem with Mutable Default Values
Consider the following example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ClubMember:
    name: str
    guests: list = []
```

In this example, the `guests` field has a mutable default value, which is an empty list `[]`. If you create multiple instances of `ClubMember` without specifying the `guests` field, they will all share the same list. Any modification to the `guests` list in one instance will be reflected in all instances.

### Example Demonstrating the Problem
```python
member1 = ClubMember(name="Alice")
member2 = ClubMember(name="Bob")

member1.guests.append("Charlie")

print(member1.guests)  # Output: ['Charlie']
print(member2.guests)  # Output: ['Charlie']
```

Here, adding "Charlie" to `member1.guests` also affects `member2.guests` because both instances share the same list.

### Correct Approach: Using `default_factory`
To avoid this problem, use `default_factory`. This creates a new list for each instance of the data class, ensuring that instances do not share the same default value.

### Corrected Example
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class ClubMember:
    name: str
    guests: list = field(default_factory=list)
```

### Example Demonstrating Correct Usage
```python
member1 = ClubMember(name="Alice")
member2 = ClubMember(name="Bob")

member1.guests.append("Charlie")

print(member1.guests)  # Output: ['Charlie']
print(member2.guests)  # Output: []
```

Now, `member1` and `member2` each have their own `guests` list, and modifying one does not affect the other.

### Summary
- **Mutable default values**: Values that can be changed, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Problem**: Shared mutable default values can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Solution**: Use `default_factory` in `@dataclass` to ensure each instance has its own separate default value.

This approach helps prevent bugs and ensures that each instance of a data class behaves independently with its own unique set of default values.
