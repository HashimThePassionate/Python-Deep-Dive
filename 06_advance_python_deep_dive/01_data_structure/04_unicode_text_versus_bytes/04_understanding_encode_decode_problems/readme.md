### Understanding Encode/Decode Problems

When dealing with text data in Python, you may encounter issues related to encoding and decoding. Python provides specific exceptions to help identify and resolve these problems.

#### Types of Unicode Errors

1. **UnicodeError**: A generic error for Unicode-related issues.
2. **UnicodeEncodeError**: Raised when converting a string (`str`) to a binary sequence (bytes) and a character is not supported by the target encoding.
3. **UnicodeDecodeError**: Raised when converting binary sequences (bytes) to a string (`str`) and the byte sequence is not valid in the specified encoding.
4. **SyntaxError**: May occur when the source encoding of a Python module is unexpected.

Understanding the specific type of error is the first step in resolving it.

### Coping with UnicodeEncodeError

Most non-UTF codecs handle only a small subset of Unicode characters. When converting text to bytes, if a character is not defined in the target encoding, a `UnicodeEncodeError` will be raised unless special handling is provided.

#### Example: Encoding to Bytes with Error Handling

```python
city = 'Pãshãwar'

# Encoding with different codecs
print(city.encode('utf_8'))       # b'S\xc3\xa3o Paulo'
print(city.encode('utf_16'))      # b'\xff\xfeS\x00\xe3\x00o\x00 \x00P\x00a\x00u\x00l\x00o\x00'
print(city.encode('iso8859_1'))   # b'S\xe3o Paulo'

# Encoding with cp437 codec without error handling
try:
    print(city.encode('cp437'))
except UnicodeEncodeError as e:
    print(e)  # UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\xe3' in position 1: character maps to <undefined>

# Encoding with cp437 codec and different error handling strategies
print(city.encode('cp437', errors='ignore'))           # b'So Paulo'
print(city.encode('cp437', errors='replace'))          # b'S?o Paulo'
print(city.encode('cp437', errors='xmlcharrefreplace'))# b'S&#227;o Paulo'
```

In this example:
- `utf_8` and `utf_16` can handle any string, including 'São Paulo'.
- `iso8859_1` can also handle the string 'São Paulo'.
- `cp437` cannot encode 'ã' (a with tilde). By default, it raises a `UnicodeEncodeError`.
- Using `errors='ignore'` skips characters that cannot be encoded, which can lead to data loss.
- Using `errors='replace'` replaces unencodable characters with '?', indicating an issue.
- Using `errors='xmlcharrefreplace'` replaces unencodable characters with their XML entity representation, which is useful when data loss is unacceptable.

### Additional Information

- **Extensible Error Handling**: You can register custom error handlers with `codecs.register_error`.
- **ASCII Compatibility**: ASCII is a common subset of many encodings. Encoding will always work if the text is made exclusively of ASCII characters. Python 3.7 introduced `str.isascii()` to check if a string is pure ASCII.

```python
# Check if a string is pure ASCII
text = "Hello"
print(text.isascii())  # True

text = "São Paulo"
print(text.isascii())  # False
```

By understanding and properly handling encoding and decoding errors, you can ensure that your applications handle text data accurately and efficiently.
