# del and Garbage Collection

## Introduction

Objects in Python are never explicitly destroyed. However, when they become unreachable, they may be garbage-collected. This process is handled by Python's garbage collector, which discards objects from memory when there are no more references to them.

## Understanding del

### Key Points about del

1. **del is a Statement**: `del` is a statement, not a function. You write `del x`, not `del(x)` (though the latter also works because `x` and `(x)` usually mean the same thing in Python).
2. **Deletes References, Not Objects**: `del` deletes references to objects, not the objects themselves. The garbage collector may discard an object if the deleted variable was the last reference to it. Rebinding a variable can also reduce the reference count to zero, causing the object to be destroyed.

### Example

```python
a = [1, 2]
b = a
del a
print(b)  # Output: [1, 2]
b = [3]
```

- **Creating and Binding**: Create an object `[1, 2]` and bind `a` to it.
- **Aliasing**: Bind `b` to the same `[1, 2]` object.
- **Deleting Reference**: Delete reference `a`.
- **Effect on Object**: `[1, 2]` is not affected because `b` still points to it.
- **Rebinding**: Rebinding `b` to a different object removes the last remaining reference to `[1, 2]`, allowing the garbage collector to discard it.

## The __del__ Method

- **Purpose**: `__del__` is a special method invoked by the Python interpreter when an instance is about to be destroyed to release external resources.
- **Usage**: You seldom need to implement `__del__` in your own code. Improper use of `__del__` can be tricky and should be avoided unless necessary.

### Example of __del__ Method

Here's an example of how to implement the `__del__` method in a class:

```python
class Resource:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        print(f'Resource {self.name} created')

    def __del__(self):
        print(f'Resource {self.name} destroyed')

# Usage
r = Resource('A')
del r  # Output: Resource A destroyed
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: When an instance of `Resource` is created, the `__init__` method initializes it.
- **Destruction**: When the instance is about to be destroyed, the `__del__` method is called, releasing the resource and printing a message.

## Garbage Collection in CPython

- **Reference Counting**: The primary algorithm for garbage collection in CPython is reference counting. Each object keeps track of how many references point to it. When the reference count reaches zero, the object is immediately destroyed.
- **Generational Garbage Collection**: CPython 2.0 introduced a generational garbage collection algorithm to detect groups of objects involved in reference cycles.

## Using weakref.finalize

To demonstrate the end of an object's life, `weakref.finalize` can be used to register a callback function to be called when an object is destroyed.

### Example

```python
import weakref

s1 = {1, 2, 3}
s2 = s1

def bye():
    print('...like tears in the rain.')

ender = weakref.finalize(s1, bye)
print(ender.alive)  # Output: True

del s1
print(ender.alive)  # Output: True

s2 = 'spam'
# Output: ...like tears in the rain.
print(ender.alive)  # Output: False
```

- **Aliasing**: `s1` and `s2` refer to the same set, `{1, 2, 3}`.
- **Registering Callback**: Register the `bye` callback on the object referred to by `s1`.
- **Attribute Check**: `ender.alive` is `True` before the finalize object is called.
- **Deleting Reference**: `del` does not delete the object, just the `s1` reference to it.
- **Rebinding Last Reference**: Rebinding `s2` makes `{1, 2, 3}` unreachable, destroying it, invoking the `bye` callback, and setting `ender.alive` to `False`.

### Explanation

- **Weak References**: `finalize` holds a weak reference to `{1, 2, 3}`, which does not increase its reference count. This allows the object to be garbage-collected even though `finalize` is monitoring it.

## Conclusion

- `del` removes references to objects, potentially leading to their garbage collection if no other references exist.
- Weak references are useful for caching applications to prevent cached objects from being kept alive solely due to their references.
- The `__del__` method can be implemented to release external resources, but it should be used sparingly and with caution.
