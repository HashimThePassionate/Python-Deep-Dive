## The `__missing__` Method

The `__missing__` method is a special method used by mappings (like dictionaries) to handle missing keys. When you subclass a dictionary (`dict`) and provide a `__missing__` method, this method is called whenever a key is not found, instead of raising a `KeyError`.

#### Item Retrieval Using `d[key]` Notation

```python
>>> d = StrKeyDict0([('2', 'two'), ('4', 'four')])
>>> d['2']
'two'
>>> d[4]
'four'
>>> d[1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
KeyError: '1'
```

#### Item Retrieval Using `d.get(key)` Notation

```python
>>> d.get('2')
'two'
>>> d.get(4)
'four'
>>> d.get(1, 'N/A')
'N/A'
```

#### Using the `in` Operator

```python
>>> 2 in d
True
>>> 1 in d
False
```


## Implementation of StrKeyDict0

Here's how you can implement `StrKeyDict0`, which converts non-string keys to strings when looked up:

```python
class StrKeyDict0(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        # Check if the key is already a string
        if isinstance(key, str):
            # If the key is a string and is missing, raise KeyError
            raise KeyError(key)
        # Convert the key to a string and try to retrieve the value
        return self[str(key)]

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        try:
            # Attempt to retrieve the value for the key
            return self[key]
        except KeyError:
            # If the key is not found, return the default value
            return default

    def __contains__(self, key):
        # Check if the key exists in the dictionary as is or as a string
        return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()
```

### Explanation of the Methods

1. **__missing__ Method**:
    - This method is invoked when a key is not found in the dictionary.
    - If the missing key is a string, it raises a `KeyError`.
    - If the missing key is not a string, it converts the key to a string and tries to retrieve the value associated with this string key.

    ```python
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]
    ```

    Example:
    ```python
    d = StrKeyDict0([('2', 'two'), ('4', 'four')])
    print(d[4])  # Output: 'four' (4 is converted to '4')
    print(d['2'])  # Output: 'two'
    ```

2. **get Method**:
    - This method tries to retrieve the value for the given key.
    - If the key is not found, it returns the default value provided.

    ```python
    def get(self, key, default=None):
        try:
            return self[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default
    ```

    Example:
    ```python
    d = StrKeyDict0([('2', 'two'), ('4', 'four')])
    print(d.get(4))  # Output: 'four' (4 is converted to '4')
    print(d.get(1, 'N/A'))  # Output: 'N/A' (1 is not found, so default value is returned)
    ```

3. **__contains__ Method**:
    - This method checks if the key exists in the dictionary.
    - It looks for the key in its original form and its string form.

    ```python
    def __contains__(self, key):
        return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()
    ```

    Example:
    ```python
    d = StrKeyDict0([('2', 'two'), ('4', 'four')])
    print(2 in d)  # Output: True (2 is converted to '2')
    print(1 in d)  # Output: False (1 is not found)
    ```

## Full Example with `__missing__` Method Call

Here is a full example demonstrating the `StrKeyDict0` class and how the `__missing__` method is called when a key is not present:

```python
class StrKeyDict0(dict):
    def __missing__(self, key):
        if isinstance(key, str):
            raise KeyError(key)
        return self[str(key)]

    def get(self, key, default=None):
        try:
            return self[key]
        except KeyError:
            return default

    def __contains__(self, key):
        return key in self.keys() or str(key) in self.keys()

# Creating an object of StrKeyDict0
d = StrKeyDict0([('2', 'two'), ('4', 'four')])

# Attempt to retrieve a key that does not exist to trigger __missing__
try:
    print(d[1])  # This should call the __missing__ method because 1 is not in the dictionary
except KeyError as e:
    print(f"KeyError: {e}")  # Output: KeyError: '1'

# Adding more examples to show how __missing__ works with non-string keys
print(d[4])  # Output: 'four' (4 is converted to '4' and found in the dictionary)
print(d.get(1, 'N/A'))  # Output: 'N/A' (1 is not found, so the default value is returned)
print(2 in d)  # Output: True (2 is converted to '2' and found in the dictionary)
print(1 in d)  # Output: False (1 is not found)
```

### Detailed Explanation of `__missing__` Method Call

1. **Creating an Object**:
    - We create an object `d` of the `StrKeyDict0` class with initial key-value pairs `('2', 'two')` and `('4', 'four')`.

2. **Accessing a Missing Key**:
    - When we try to access `d[1]`, the key `1` is not found in the dictionary.
    - The `__getitem__` method inherited from `dict` calls the `__missing__` method because `1` is missing.
    - Inside the `__missing__` method:
        - It checks if the key `1` is a string. It is not.
        - It converts the key `1` to a string `'1'`.
        - It attempts to retrieve the value for the string key `'1'`.
        - Since `'1'` is also not in the dictionary, it raises a `KeyError`.

3. **Output of `__missing__` Method Call**:
    - The `KeyError` is caught in the `except` block and prints `KeyError: '1'`.

### Other Examples:

- **Retrieving an Existing Key**:
    - `d[4]` converts the integer key `4` to the string `'4'` and finds the corresponding value `'four'`.

- **Using `get` Method**:
    - `d.get(1, 'N/A')` returns the default value `'N/A'` because `1` (or `'1'`) is not found in the dictionary.

- **Checking Membership**:
    - `2 in d` returns `True` because `2` is converted to `'2'` and found in the dictionary.
    - `1 in d` returns `False` because `1` (or `'1'`) is not found in the dictionary.
