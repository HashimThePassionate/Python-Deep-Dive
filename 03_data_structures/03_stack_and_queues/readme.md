#  **Stacks and Queues** 📚

## 🌟 Introduction

In this section, we will discuss two very important data structures: **stacks** and **queues**. These fundamental data structures have numerous critical applications across computer science and software engineering.

## 🚀 Key Applications

Stacks and queues play vital roles in many important applications, including:

- 🖥️ **Operating System Architecture**
- ➕ **Arithmetic Expression Evaluation**
- ⚖️ **Load Balancing**
- 🖨️ **Managing Printing Jobs**
- 🔍 **Data Traversal Operations**

## 📊 Data Storage Characteristics

In stack and queue data structures:

- 📈 Data is stored **sequentially**, similar to arrays and linked lists
- 🎯 Unlike arrays and linked lists, data is handled in a **specific order**
- 🔒 Operations follow **certain constraints** that we'll explore in detail
- 📝 These constraints define how data can be accessed and manipulated

## 🛠️ Implementation Methods

Throughout this section, we'll examine multiple approaches to implement stacks and queues:

- 🔗 **Using Linked Lists**
- 📋 **Using Arrays**
- 🐍 **Python Implementation Examples**
