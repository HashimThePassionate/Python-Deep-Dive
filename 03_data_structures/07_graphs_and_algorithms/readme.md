# 📊 **Graphs and Algorithms**

Graphs are a **non-linear data structure** in which the problem is represented as a **network** by connecting a set of **nodes** with **edges**.

For example:

* In a graph, **nodes** can represent **different cities**.
* The **links (edges)** between them represent **connections** (like roads or flights).

Graphs are one of the most important data structures because they are widely used to solve computing problems—especially when the problem involves **objects and their connections**, such as finding the **shortest path** between two cities.

Graphs provide an efficient way to represent **real-world problems** as **network-like structures** for analysis and optimization.
