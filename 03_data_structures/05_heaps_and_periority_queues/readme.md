# 🌳 **Heaps and Priority Queues**

A **heap** is a **tree-based data structure** in which each **node** has a specific relationship with other nodes, and they are stored in a particular **order**.

Depending on how nodes are arranged, heaps can be of two main types:

* 🔽 **Min Heap** → The smallest element is always at the root.
* 🔼 **Max Heap** → The largest element is always at the root.

## 🛠️ Priority Queue

A **priority queue** is an important data structure that is similar to **queues** and **stacks**, but with a twist:

👉 It stores **data along with their priority**.
👉 Elements are served **based on priority** instead of arrival order.

**Implementation options**:

* 📦 Array
* 🔗 Linked List
* 🌲 Trees

⚡ But the **most efficient implementation** is using a **heap**.
