#  **Trees in Data Structures** 🌳

##  Introduction 📚

A **tree** is a hierarchical, non-linear data structure.
Unlike **lists**, **queues**, and **stacks** (which are linear and store items sequentially), a **tree** organizes data with a **parent-child relationship**.

* The **top node** in a tree is called the **root node**.
* The root node acts as the **ancestor** of all other nodes in the tree.

##  Why Are Trees Important? 🚀

**Tree data structures** are vital in computer science due to their use in:

* Parsing expressions (e.g., arithmetic, logical)
* Efficient searching (e.g., in databases, file systems)
* Implementing **priority queues**
* Representing structured documents (like **XML** and **HTML**)
