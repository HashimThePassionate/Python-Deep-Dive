#  **Algorithm Design Techniques and Strategies** üìö

In the field of computing, **algorithm design** is a fundamental skill for IT professionals, essential for enhancing expertise and enabling career growth.  
The algorithm design process begins with a substantial number of real-world computing problems, which must be clearly formulated to efficiently build a solution using appropriate techniques.

The world of algorithms provides a wide range of techniques and design principles. Mastery of these methods is crucial for tackling complex and sophisticated problems.  
Efficient algorithm design is critical in **computer science** for constructing precise and optimal solutions for well-defined problems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Algorithm Design Techniques

We will explore the following major algorithm design strategies:

### üîπ 1. Divide and Conquer
A technique that breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and combines the results to form the solution.

### üîπ 2. Dynamic Programming
An approach that solves problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems, storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

### üîπ 3. Greedy Algorithms
A method that builds a solution step-by-step, choosing the locally optimal choice at each step with the aim of reaching a global optimum.
